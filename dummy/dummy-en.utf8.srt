3
00:00:38,995 --> 00:00:40,736
Shit.

4
00:00:40,736 --> 00:00:42,433
Hello?

5
00:00:42,433 --> 00:00:43,826
NAOMI [over phone]:
Andy.

6
00:00:43,826 --> 00:00:45,784
Yeah. Naomi?

7
00:00:45,784 --> 00:00:48,613
W-Wait, where are you?
How come you're not home?

8
00:00:48,613 --> 00:00:50,180
I'm-I'm sorry to wake you

9
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:51,486
in the middle of the night.

10
00:00:51,486 --> 00:00:53,183
Hey, what's going on?
Where are you?

11
00:00:53,183 --> 00:00:54,924
Listen, I'm gonna tell you,

12
00:00:54,924 --> 00:00:57,492
but I don't want you
to freak out, okay?

13
00:00:57,492 --> 00:00:59,233
Wait a minute, freak out?

14
00:00:59,233 --> 00:01:00,756
What's going on?
You're scaring me.

15
00:01:00,756 --> 00:01:02,497
Are you okay?

16
00:01:02,497 --> 00:01:05,282
Yeah. No, I'm okay. Um...

17
00:01:05,282 --> 00:01:06,849
I'm gonna be fine.

18
00:01:06,849 --> 00:01:08,807
But, Andy...

19
00:01:08,807 --> 00:01:10,722
I'm in rehab.

20
00:01:11,114 --> 00:01:12,594
No, hon, seriously,
where are you?

21
00:01:12,594 --> 00:01:15,031
-I'm in rehab.
- You're what?!

22
00:01:15,031 --> 00:01:17,599
No... [stammers] That's
why I said don't freak out!

23
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:19,905
Okay? I checked myself in,
like, an hour ago.

24
00:01:19,905 --> 00:01:21,820
Didn't you notice
I didn't come home?

25
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:24,562
Wait a minute. Hold on.
Wait.

26
00:01:24,562 --> 00:01:25,998
Wait a minute.

27
00:01:25,998 --> 00:01:27,783
What are you talking about?

28
00:01:27,783 --> 00:01:28,958
Why would you...

29
00:01:28,958 --> 00:01:30,873
Why would you be in rehab?
For what?

30
00:01:30,873 --> 00:01:33,702
Because I need help,
Andy. Why else?

31
00:01:33,702 --> 00:01:36,313
Wait a minute. What...

32
00:01:36,313 --> 00:01:38,228
Wait a minute.

33
00:01:38,228 --> 00:01:40,535
What are you talking-- I don't
understand. -Okay, hold on.

34
00:01:40,535 --> 00:01:42,319
- Are you telling me--
- Help with what?

35
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:44,974
This is amazing.

36
00:01:44,974 --> 00:01:46,802
- You didn't know?
- Know what?

37
00:01:46,802 --> 00:01:48,586
- Oh, my God. Unbelievable.
-  Naomi, I don't know--

38
00:01:48,586 --> 00:01:50,414
- Unbelievable.
- I-I-I don't--

39
00:01:50,414 --> 00:01:52,112
Of course. -Thought you were
lying there in bed with me.

40
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:53,461
No, I don't know...

41
00:01:53,461 --> 00:01:55,376
Honey. Honey, look.

42
00:01:55,376 --> 00:01:56,768
Naomi, look,

43
00:01:56,768 --> 00:01:58,727
sometimes you probably drink
a little too much.

44
00:01:58,727 --> 00:02:00,642
- Oh, Andy, come on.
- It's not good, I know.

45
00:02:00,642 --> 00:02:02,339
But, you know,
everybody does that.

46
00:02:02,339 --> 00:02:04,950
- But rehab? You're crazy.
- No, it's not--

47
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:07,127
It-- Listen,
it is not the drinking.

48
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:09,129
I have to take something
to wake up. -What?

49
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:11,131
And I take something
to go to sleep.

50
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:13,916
And I... I've seen
every doctor in L.A.

51
00:02:13,916 --> 00:02:15,570
I even had to drive
to Orange County.

52
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:18,312
Orange County? What the--
You... [stammers] -Yeah.

53
00:02:18,312 --> 00:02:20,009
Wait a minute. This is, like...

54
00:02:20,009 --> 00:02:23,230
Honestly, honestly, I'm
telling you, this is so insane.

55
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:25,145
I feel like I'm hallucinating
or something.

56
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:27,277
Of course you didn't know.
Of course you didn't know.

57
00:02:27,277 --> 00:02:28,409
Why would you know?

58
00:02:28,409 --> 00:02:29,845
You're out the door
every morning

59
00:02:29,845 --> 00:02:31,020
before I can get a word in,

60
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:32,717
and you're out every night
for work.

61
00:02:32,717 --> 00:02:34,980
We lead totally separate lives,
and I'm just...

62
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:37,200
- I'm invisible.
-  So this is my fault?

63
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,463
How can you know nothing
about my life?

64
00:02:39,463 --> 00:02:41,639
I have this enormous weight,

65
00:02:41,639 --> 00:02:44,033
and I've been carrying it
around for so long.

66
00:02:44,033 --> 00:02:45,556
And I cannot do it anymore.

67
00:02:45,556 --> 00:02:46,905
Wai-Wait a minute,
wait a minute.

68
00:02:46,905 --> 00:02:49,038
Wait. Okay.
This is just not true.

69
00:02:49,038 --> 00:02:51,606
- How can you say that?
- This is just not true.

70
00:02:51,606 --> 00:02:52,607
Then enlighten me.

71
00:02:52,607 --> 00:02:54,217
Okay. You're upset.

72
00:02:54,217 --> 00:02:57,002
I get that.
But, h-honey, I know you.

73
00:02:57,002 --> 00:02:58,961
You're a wonderful mother.

74
00:02:58,961 --> 00:03:01,137
I'm sorry.

75
00:03:01,137 --> 00:03:03,313
- The woman I live with...
- Andy.

76
00:03:03,313 --> 00:03:04,662
...doesn't have
a drug addiction. -Andy.

77
00:03:04,662 --> 00:03:06,969
- You just don't.
- Hey. Hey.

78
00:03:06,969 --> 00:03:08,275
You're not hearing me.

79
00:03:08,275 --> 00:03:09,537
You're not listening to me.

80
00:03:09,537 --> 00:03:11,452
I've checked into
a rehabilitation center

81
00:03:11,452 --> 00:03:12,975
- called Journeys.
- Journeys?

82
00:03:12,975 --> 00:03:14,803
It's on Malibu Canyon Road.

83
00:03:14,803 --> 00:03:17,371
It has yellow walls and a woman
at the front desk named Cecile,

84
00:03:17,371 --> 00:03:19,677
and I am staying here
for 90 days. -

85
00:03:19,677 --> 00:03:20,896
Wait a minute. What?

86
00:03:20,896 --> 00:03:22,811
- I got to go.
- 90 days?

87
00:03:22,811 --> 00:03:25,074
- Take care of the kids, Andy.
- 90 days?

88
00:03:25,074 --> 00:03:26,118
You'll do great.

89
00:03:26,118 --> 00:03:27,729
Wait, no. No, no, no.

90
00:03:27,729 --> 00:03:28,991
I'm coming up right now.

91
00:03:28,991 --> 00:03:30,471
Just stay put, and we'll talk.

92
00:03:30,471 --> 00:03:32,299
NAOMI [distorted]:
No, don't come...

93
00:03:32,299 --> 00:03:34,953
Can't-- I can't hear you.

94
00:03:34,953 --> 00:03:36,346
Wait, you're cutting out.

95
00:03:36,346 --> 00:03:38,087
No, I said don't come, Andy.

96
00:03:38,087 --> 00:03:40,611
Look, look, h-here, I'll be
up there in an hour. -No.

97
00:03:40,611 --> 00:03:42,613
I'll be up there in an hour.
We'll drive back down here

98
00:03:42,613 --> 00:03:44,180
and we'll talk about it.

99
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:46,400
Andy, do-do not come.

100
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,228
I am... you.

101
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:50,360
I c-- I can't hear you.

102
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,797
I'm leaving you.

103
00:03:54,625 --> 00:03:55,800
What?

104
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:59,326
I'm leaving you!

105
00:04:15,342 --> 00:04:16,952
-

106
00:04:16,952 --> 00:04:18,997
...deep breaths,
in and out, in and out.

107
00:04:18,997 --> 00:04:20,738
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

108
00:04:20,738 --> 00:04:22,479
I'm sorry I'm late. -No, no,
it's okay. Don't worry.

109
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:24,089
Hi. -I wish we could
start without you. Hi.

110
00:04:24,089 --> 00:04:25,482
- Mm.
- So how did it go?

111
00:04:25,482 --> 00:04:26,918
I don't know
why this is still a thing.

112
00:04:26,918 --> 00:04:28,180
I should not be this afraid

113
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:30,270
to tell my female boss
that I'm pregnant.

114
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,272
Uh, Grace,
this happens every day.

115
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:34,230
Come. Flip with me.

116
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:36,014
Okay.

117
00:04:36,014 --> 00:04:38,103
- Okay.
- Hello, both of you!

118
00:04:38,103 --> 00:04:40,671
Hi. -Dr. Verma,
I'm so sorry I'm late.

119
00:04:40,671 --> 00:04:43,283
Oh, that is
totally, totally fine.

120
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:44,327
Okay.

121
00:04:44,327 --> 00:04:45,676
How are you two doing?

122
00:04:45,676 --> 00:04:48,113
Actually, I'm-I'm having
really bad heartburn.

123
00:04:48,113 --> 00:04:50,028
- Oh, no.
- Here.

124
00:04:50,028 --> 00:04:52,030
- Mm-hmm.
- Is that, um... is that normal?

125
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:53,728
- Uh...
- Well, we had Thai last night.

126
00:04:53,728 --> 00:04:55,382
Couldn't that be why?
I think it could be why.

127
00:04:55,382 --> 00:04:58,210
-I would just
avoid fried food or spicy food

128
00:04:58,210 --> 00:05:00,169
- at this stage.
-Okay.

129
00:05:00,169 --> 00:05:01,779
Well, let's just add that
to the list.

130
00:05:01,779 --> 00:05:03,390
No spicy food, no fried food,

131
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:04,695
no caffeine, no alcohol,

132
00:05:04,695 --> 00:05:06,001
- no sushi...
- No sex.

133
00:05:07,132 --> 00:05:08,743
Actually, perfectly fine
to have sex.

134
00:05:08,743 --> 00:05:10,048
Good, even.

135
00:05:10,048 --> 00:05:11,920
I knew it. I'm-I'm a doctor,
for God's sake.

136
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:14,401
'Kay. -Mwah. I knew that
wasn't true. -

137
00:05:14,705 --> 00:05:16,098
- Okay.
- Okay.

138
00:05:16,098 --> 00:05:18,056
All right.
Just take a look, shall we?

139
00:05:19,971 --> 00:05:22,017
Do you hear that sound?

140
00:05:22,017 --> 00:05:25,063
It's the sound of
a perfectly healthy heartbeat.

141
00:05:29,546 --> 00:05:30,765
- Just answer him.
- No, baby.

142
00:05:30,765 --> 00:05:32,375
It's fine. It's okay.

143
00:05:32,375 --> 00:05:34,029
Grace, my advice to
you, as always, is relax.

144
00:05:34,029 --> 00:05:35,944
Everything looks fantastic.

145
00:05:35,944 --> 00:05:37,641
And I will see you guys back
in a month.

146
00:05:37,641 --> 00:05:38,990
-Great.
- Okay. Thank you.

147
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:40,818
-Of course.
-Oh, Dr. Verma,

148
00:05:40,818 --> 00:05:42,037
- can I ask you a question?
- Yeah. Will you follow me?

149
00:05:42,037 --> 00:05:43,604
- You good?
- Yeah. For sure.

150
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,869
What's up, Dad?

151
00:05:47,869 --> 00:05:49,479
Naomi's in rehab.

152
00:05:49,479 --> 00:05:50,611
What?

153
00:05:50,611 --> 00:05:54,049
She's addicted to pills, apparently.

154
00:05:54,049 --> 00:05:56,094
And-and-and she's left me.

155
00:05:56,094 --> 00:05:58,053
We're separated, I guess.
Jesus.

156
00:05:58,053 --> 00:05:59,228
Wait, seriously?

157
00:05:59,228 --> 00:06:00,360
Yes. Seriously.

158
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,710
What about the twins?
Do they know?

159
00:06:03,885 --> 00:06:05,582
I'll talk to them tonight.

160
00:06:05,582 --> 00:06:07,367
- Dad.
- I will. I already told them

161
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:10,239
Naomi had a doctor's
appointment this morning.

162
00:06:11,066 --> 00:06:13,938
You didn't seem really
surprised when I told you

163
00:06:13,938 --> 00:06:15,113
Naomi's in rehab.

164
00:06:15,113 --> 00:06:17,072
Did you suspect something
about her?

165
00:06:17,072 --> 00:06:20,118
I don't know. I guess it's not,
like, that big of a shocker.

166
00:06:20,554 --> 00:06:22,730
Not a shocker?
What's that mean?

167
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:24,384
Oh, look, uh,
let me-- let me... -Hey.

168
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:25,776
...let me call you back
from the car, okay? -Let's go.

169
00:06:25,776 --> 00:06:27,387
- I-I got to go.
-Okay. But, wait,

170
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:29,389
did you know
she was taking pills?

171
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:30,868
Dad, I got to go.
I'll call you right back.

172
00:06:30,868 --> 00:06:32,261
God, is there traffic
all the time? -

173
00:06:32,261 --> 00:06:33,741
What is it? What's he want?

174
00:06:33,741 --> 00:06:37,135
Well, so, Naomi checked herself
into rehab

175
00:06:37,135 --> 00:06:38,354
and she left him.

176
00:06:38,354 --> 00:06:39,442
Stop. What...

177
00:06:39,442 --> 00:06:41,139
Wait, wait,
what's she in rehab for?

178
00:06:41,139 --> 00:06:42,532
Prescription drugs, I think.

179
00:06:42,532 --> 00:06:44,316
How did he not tell you
about this before?

180
00:06:44,316 --> 00:06:46,144
'Cause he didn't know.

181
00:06:46,144 --> 00:06:48,973
Who doesn't know that
their wife is addicted to drugs?

182
00:06:51,672 --> 00:06:53,108
What the fuck?

183
00:06:53,108 --> 00:06:55,023
This looks like a country club.

184
00:06:55,023 --> 00:06:56,764
Jesus.

185
00:07:01,551 --> 00:07:03,423
Hi. I'm Andy Goodrich,

186
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:05,512
and I'm here to see
Naomi Parsons.

187
00:07:05,512 --> 00:07:07,165
She checked in last night.

188
00:07:07,165 --> 00:07:08,776
Hello.

189
00:07:08,776 --> 00:07:10,604
Oh. Hi.

190
00:07:10,604 --> 00:07:12,170
- Sorry.
- That's okay.

191
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:15,347
All right,
let me check on that for you.

192
00:07:15,347 --> 00:07:16,827
And Ms. Parsons
is expecting you?

193
00:07:16,827 --> 00:07:18,655
Yeah. No.

194
00:07:18,655 --> 00:07:20,265
I mean, not really.
But I'm her husband.

195
00:07:20,265 --> 00:07:21,571
- So...
- Right.

196
00:07:21,571 --> 00:07:23,399
Well, I am so sorry,
Mr. Goodrich.

197
00:07:23,399 --> 00:07:25,270
We're not at liberty
to confirm or deny

198
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:26,968
that Ms. Parsons is here.

199
00:07:26,968 --> 00:07:28,883
No, I know she's here.
I mean...

200
00:07:28,883 --> 00:07:31,407
I mean, I know she's here
'cause she told me she's here.

201
00:07:31,407 --> 00:07:34,715
I didn't know
that she was checking in,

202
00:07:34,715 --> 00:07:36,020
- so yeah.
- And I understand that.

203
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:37,282
And I will let her know

204
00:07:37,282 --> 00:07:38,588
that you've stopped in.

205
00:07:38,588 --> 00:07:41,069
Well, no, just tell her
I'm here now.

206
00:07:41,069 --> 00:07:41,983
I mean, you don't have to--

207
00:07:41,983 --> 00:07:43,941
Here I am now. Just-just...

208
00:07:43,941 --> 00:07:46,378
let her know. -I wish I could,
but I just can't.

209
00:07:46,378 --> 00:07:48,729
Do you have, like,
some sort of a...

210
00:07:48,729 --> 00:07:50,818
I don't know, say, somebody...

211
00:07:50,818 --> 00:07:53,037
- a little higher up? Yeah.
- Oh. Yeah, sure.

212
00:07:53,037 --> 00:07:55,779
And I'm afraid she's just
gonna tell you that Ms. Parsons

213
00:07:55,779 --> 00:07:58,913
has pulled both her and
our consent to speak with you.

214
00:07:58,913 --> 00:08:00,305
Okay.

215
00:08:00,305 --> 00:08:01,481
Okay, look--

216
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:03,526
I can leave a message.

217
00:08:03,918 --> 00:08:05,485
- I'll leave a message.
- Okay.

218
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:06,790
I want to see my fucking wife!

219
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:09,097
-I'm sorry.

220
00:08:10,794 --> 00:08:12,492
- Hello?
-Hi.

221
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:14,972
I'm calling from Crosswinds
Park Elementary School.

222
00:08:14,972 --> 00:08:16,800
- Yeah.
- Is somebody coming

223
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,280
to pick up Billie and Mose?

224
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:20,108
- BILLIE and MOSE: Dad.
- Sorry. I said I was sorry.

225
00:08:20,108 --> 00:08:21,457
I mean, what do you want me
to say? -

226
00:08:21,457 --> 00:08:23,067
I didn't realize
it was a half day,

227
00:08:23,067 --> 00:08:24,634
and I was far away, so...

228
00:08:24,634 --> 00:08:26,680
It's just so embarrassing
not getting picked up.

229
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,812
I mean, it's, like,
pretty much the worst feeling

230
00:08:28,812 --> 00:08:31,119
- in the entire world.
- It's like the worst feeling

231
00:08:31,119 --> 00:08:33,513
in the entire world
or it is the worst feeling

232
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:35,515
in the entire world? -Hey,
if you don't want me to talk

233
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:37,299
like I'm from L.A.,
don't raise me in L.A.

234
00:08:37,299 --> 00:08:38,605
Hey, hey, hey, don't do that.

235
00:08:38,605 --> 00:08:40,128
You're gonna scratch
the dining room table.

236
00:08:40,128 --> 00:08:41,259
Come on.

237
00:08:41,259 --> 00:08:42,565
Where's Mom?

238
00:08:42,565 --> 00:08:44,306
She would never forget.

239
00:08:44,306 --> 00:08:45,960
Yeah, and Mom always leaves
a glass of water

240
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:48,615
by my bed at night,
and she didn't last night.

241
00:08:48,615 --> 00:08:50,181
Yeah.

242
00:08:50,181 --> 00:08:52,923
I-I wanted to tell you guys
something about Mom, okay?

243
00:08:52,923 --> 00:08:54,490
Uh...

244
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:56,361
What gives?

245
00:08:56,361 --> 00:08:58,973
Mom had to go back home
for a little while

246
00:08:58,973 --> 00:09:00,365
to see Grandma.

247
00:09:00,365 --> 00:09:01,671
Mom's in St. Louis?

248
00:09:01,671 --> 00:09:02,846
I thought you said she had

249
00:09:02,846 --> 00:09:05,066
a doctor's appointment
this morning.

250
00:09:05,066 --> 00:09:06,371
Yeah. No.

251
00:09:06,371 --> 00:09:08,199
I'm sorry. I said that
because I didn't...

252
00:09:08,199 --> 00:09:10,071
want you guys to worry.

253
00:09:10,071 --> 00:09:13,378
But Mom had to go back and see
Grandma because, you know,

254
00:09:13,378 --> 00:09:14,684
she's not feeling very well.

255
00:09:14,684 --> 00:09:16,686
It's nothing serious,
but, you know, sh...

256
00:09:16,686 --> 00:09:19,036
And, you know,
she's getting older,

257
00:09:19,036 --> 00:09:21,430
so Mom wanted to go back and be
with her for a little bit.

258
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:23,214
Grandma's the same age as you.

259
00:09:23,214 --> 00:09:25,129
No, she's not.

260
00:09:25,129 --> 00:09:26,783
No, she's not. She... Sh...

261
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:28,916
Good deal older than I am.
But, anyway...

262
00:09:28,916 --> 00:09:31,614
So, it's just gonna be us then?

263
00:09:31,614 --> 00:09:32,876
Yeah.

264
00:09:32,876 --> 00:09:33,747
Just us.

265
00:09:33,747 --> 00:09:35,487
It's gonna be fun, right?

266
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:36,532
Be good.

267
00:09:36,532 --> 00:09:38,839
Right?

268
00:09:39,491 --> 00:09:40,884
I'm gonna go play Forza.

269
00:09:40,884 --> 00:09:42,582
Hey, wait, I get to use
the computer first today!

270
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:44,192
Whoever gets to it first
gets to use it first.

271
00:09:44,192 --> 00:09:45,323
You used it two days
over the weekend.

272
00:09:45,323 --> 00:09:46,934
I did not...

273
00:09:46,934 --> 00:09:48,196
Mom says
we're not supposed to have

274
00:09:48,196 --> 00:09:49,719
this much gluten, you know.

275
00:09:49,719 --> 00:09:51,199
She says it's bad for our guts.

276
00:09:51,199 --> 00:09:52,504
Honey, honey, honey.

277
00:09:52,504 --> 00:09:54,594
Put a paper towel down.

278
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:55,812
You have to respect wood.

279
00:09:55,812 --> 00:09:58,641
It sounds like
Mom's maybe making you...

280
00:09:58,641 --> 00:10:00,208
a little bit crazy.

281
00:10:00,208 --> 00:10:01,165
Tell you why.

282
00:10:01,165 --> 00:10:03,603
'Cause gluten happens to be...

283
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:05,256
delicious.

284
00:10:05,256 --> 00:10:06,606
Mmm!

285
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:07,694
That's some good gluten.

286
00:10:07,694 --> 00:10:10,740
Okay, want me
to make you a plate?

287
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:12,873
- Um, we do it ourselves.
- Okay.

288
00:10:12,873 --> 00:10:15,440
Well, then bon appétit!

289
00:10:17,051 --> 00:10:19,009
Dad, are there nuts in that?

290
00:10:19,009 --> 00:10:20,968
- Why? Are you allergic?
- Mose is.

291
00:10:20,968 --> 00:10:23,144
Mose. Oh, shit, I forgot.
Jesus, spit.

292
00:10:23,144 --> 00:10:24,275
Spit, spit. Here, gimme.

293
00:10:24,275 --> 00:10:25,450
- Mose. Give it to me.
- Oh, my God.

294
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:28,018
- Spit. Spit.
- Come on! Dad.

295
00:10:28,453 --> 00:10:29,585
Jesus.

296
00:10:31,239 --> 00:10:34,938
Pasta with butter and cheese.

297
00:10:34,938 --> 00:10:37,898
- Specialty of the house.
- Mom puts salt in the water.

298
00:10:37,898 --> 00:10:39,813
Good tip. That's a good tip.

299
00:10:39,813 --> 00:10:41,553
Salt, salt, salt, salt.

300
00:10:41,553 --> 00:10:42,467
I see pepper.

301
00:10:42,467 --> 00:10:44,339
- I don't see--
- Top shelf.

302
00:10:44,339 --> 00:10:46,341
Oh.

303
00:10:47,255 --> 00:10:49,866
Kind of far for salt.

304
00:10:50,345 --> 00:10:53,391
Here you go. Some salt.

305
00:10:54,175 --> 00:10:56,917
Hey, Dad,
can we watch TV while we eat?

306
00:10:56,917 --> 00:10:58,788
Can't we just talk?

307
00:10:58,788 --> 00:11:00,485
I'm going out tonight, and...

308
00:11:00,485 --> 00:11:01,661
and, uh...

309
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:03,184
I don't know.

310
00:11:03,184 --> 00:11:05,316
Just rather spend time together
before I go out.

311
00:11:05,316 --> 00:11:06,622
Where are you going?

312
00:11:06,622 --> 00:11:08,319
- Got a thing.
- What kind of thing?

313
00:11:08,319 --> 00:11:09,669
Dinner thing.

314
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:11,627
- We're eating dinner right now.
- I know.

315
00:11:11,627 --> 00:11:12,802
But this is a dinner-work thing.

316
00:11:12,802 --> 00:11:13,803
I'm gonna meet a new artist.

317
00:11:13,803 --> 00:11:16,240
- Who's babysitting us?
- Tali.

318
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,286
Did you know
Tali was in the Israeli army?

319
00:11:18,286 --> 00:11:19,722
That's why I hired her.

320
00:11:19,722 --> 00:11:21,681
Did you know that
she smokes cigarettes outside?

321
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:23,987
That's new information.
Thank you.

322
00:11:23,987 --> 00:11:25,772
I'm gonna talk to her
about that.

323
00:11:25,772 --> 00:11:28,688
This about the smoking?
She's a narc, that little girl.

324
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:31,386
No, it's not about the smoking,
but, you know, if you could,

325
00:11:31,386 --> 00:11:34,171
you know, maybe do a few less
cancer-causing habits

326
00:11:34,171 --> 00:11:36,826
around the kids, that'd be
a good thing, okay? -

327
00:11:36,826 --> 00:11:40,787
No, uh,
what I wanted to say is...

328
00:11:42,179 --> 00:11:44,138
Naomi's gone away.

329
00:11:44,138 --> 00:11:45,705
And, uh...

330
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:47,271
I'm gonna need an extra hand.

331
00:11:47,271 --> 00:11:48,359
No problem.

332
00:11:48,359 --> 00:11:49,578
Where she go? Rehab?

333
00:11:49,578 --> 00:11:50,927
You knew about this?

334
00:11:50,927 --> 00:11:53,582
Andy, of course I know.

335
00:11:53,582 --> 00:11:54,801
Course I know. Good for her.

336
00:11:54,801 --> 00:11:56,498
It's good. She's getting help.

337
00:11:56,498 --> 00:11:57,760
Why are you stressed?

338
00:11:58,935 --> 00:12:00,154
You didn't know?

339
00:12:00,154 --> 00:12:02,460
- I didn't know.
- Ah.

340
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:04,114
Andy, this is not good.

341
00:12:04,114 --> 00:12:06,769
I know. -Listen,
I'll help, okay? I understand.

342
00:12:06,769 --> 00:12:08,510
- Marriage is tough, okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

343
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:10,512
My-my husband is a gay.

344
00:12:10,512 --> 00:12:12,819
What do you mean
your husband is a gay?

345
00:12:12,819 --> 00:12:13,907
Eh, my husband is gay.

346
00:12:13,907 --> 00:12:15,343
He lives in Tel Aviv.

347
00:12:15,343 --> 00:12:16,736
Very good-looking boyfriend.

348
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:18,650
I mean, uh, mamash wow!

349
00:12:18,650 --> 00:12:20,043
Don't blame him.

350
00:12:20,043 --> 00:12:21,175
Wait a minute, he's a gay?

351
00:12:21,175 --> 00:12:22,698
He's got a--
he's got a boyfriend?

352
00:12:22,698 --> 00:12:24,352
- Why are you still together?
- Why not?

353
00:12:24,352 --> 00:12:25,570
Andy, loosen up.

354
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:26,441
What time you'll be home?

355
00:12:26,441 --> 00:12:28,138
3:00, 4:00 in the morning?

356
00:12:28,138 --> 00:12:29,531
No. Like, 11:00.

357
00:12:29,531 --> 00:12:30,750
What do you mean,
3:00 in the morning? -Okay.

358
00:12:40,498 --> 00:12:42,457
- Hey! Becca. You're back.
- Hey!

359
00:12:42,457 --> 00:12:43,980
Yes. -How you doing?
How you feeling?

360
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:45,416
- So much better.
- Good, good.

361
00:12:45,416 --> 00:12:47,636
- Thanks, Andy.
- I'm glad you're back.

362
00:12:47,984 --> 00:12:49,769
Hey. Careful.

363
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:51,771
Don't drop that, boys.

364
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:52,989
Yeah.

365
00:12:52,989 --> 00:12:54,904
Perfect.

366
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,778
- Good.
-Oh, good, you're here.

367
00:12:58,778 --> 00:12:59,909
Finally.

368
00:12:59,909 --> 00:13:00,823
The sign outside.

369
00:13:00,823 --> 00:13:02,085
Yeah.

370
00:13:02,085 --> 00:13:03,783
Killing me. Looks horrible.

371
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:05,045
Worse every day.

372
00:13:05,045 --> 00:13:06,524
Get me a second quote
for a new one, okay?

373
00:13:06,524 --> 00:13:07,612
8,000.

374
00:13:07,612 --> 00:13:09,179
8,000?

375
00:13:09,179 --> 00:13:11,268
- I'll-I'll get a third quote.
- Yeah.

376
00:13:11,268 --> 00:13:13,140
- How did dinner go last night?
- I don't know.

377
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:15,185
Think he's talking to
a lot of people, which is,

378
00:13:15,185 --> 00:13:16,665
you know, cool.

379
00:13:16,665 --> 00:13:18,449
- Did he call?
- Uh, no.

380
00:13:18,449 --> 00:13:20,712
But Dev did, and y-you're not
gonna like this,

381
00:13:20,712 --> 00:13:22,018
but he decided to give the piece

382
00:13:22,018 --> 00:13:24,455
that you wanted to sell to Inga
to his mother.

383
00:13:24,455 --> 00:13:26,240
Get-- Are you serious?

384
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:29,199
God. You know what,
get him on the phone.

385
00:13:29,199 --> 00:13:30,810
I'll-I'll talk-- No.

386
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:31,898
Get me the mother.

387
00:13:31,898 --> 00:13:33,290
Okay. And just a reminder--

388
00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:34,726
you have Back-to-School Night
tonight.

389
00:13:34,726 --> 00:13:36,119
Naomi asked me to put it
on your schedule

390
00:13:36,119 --> 00:13:38,034
- in case you can make it.
- Okay.

391
00:13:38,034 --> 00:13:39,209
Do all the parents do that

392
00:13:39,209 --> 00:13:41,168
or is that, like,
an optional thing?

393
00:13:42,386 --> 00:13:43,866
I-I don't-- I don't know, man.

394
00:13:43,866 --> 00:13:45,955
I'm 27.

395
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:47,696
Cy's in your office.

396
00:13:47,696 --> 00:13:48,828
You guys had a meeting
with an accountant,

397
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:50,133
like, 15 minutes ago.

398
00:13:50,133 --> 00:13:51,134
Yeah, yeah.

399
00:13:51,134 --> 00:13:53,354
Andy, you asked for it

400
00:13:53,354 --> 00:13:54,616
in black and white, so...

401
00:13:54,616 --> 00:13:58,315
Look, I can't control
the market, right?

402
00:13:58,315 --> 00:14:00,143
I mean, you know,

403
00:14:00,143 --> 00:14:02,015
nobody needs a painting.

404
00:14:02,015 --> 00:14:04,756
Let's rewind for a sec. So you
took a loan out from the bank

405
00:14:04,756 --> 00:14:05,975
to meet your obligations,

406
00:14:05,975 --> 00:14:08,282
but there are salaries
to pay here, Andy.

407
00:14:08,282 --> 00:14:09,500
Too many
for what you're bringing in.

408
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:10,937
I've been telling you this
for months.

409
00:14:10,937 --> 00:14:12,677
Yeah,
we've been discussing that.

410
00:14:12,677 --> 00:14:13,940
Oh. -It's just... coming up
on the end of the year,

411
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:15,115
we're not sure
it's the best time

412
00:14:15,115 --> 00:14:16,159
- to let people go.
- Right.

413
00:14:16,159 --> 00:14:17,378
Guys, come on.

414
00:14:17,378 --> 00:14:18,988
You're just covering costs.

415
00:14:18,988 --> 00:14:20,860
And then each month, the tidal
wave rolls through again.

416
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,644
You have to borrow
from Peter to pay Paul.

417
00:14:22,644 --> 00:14:23,950
At some point, Peter goes broke.

418
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:25,081
May I?

419
00:14:25,081 --> 00:14:27,562
- Please.
- Andy.

420
00:14:27,997 --> 00:14:32,132
I think, in fact, it may be
time to consider relocating.

421
00:14:32,132 --> 00:14:35,439
I know we've been here 26 years,
but the rent is killing us.

422
00:14:35,439 --> 00:14:36,527
Cy.

423
00:14:36,527 --> 00:14:38,268
Come on.

424
00:14:38,268 --> 00:14:40,662
There's history here, you know?

425
00:14:42,403 --> 00:14:43,752
28 years, by the way.

426
00:14:43,752 --> 00:14:45,623
Andy, look at it this way.

427
00:14:45,623 --> 00:14:47,190
Your artists just aren't
commanding the prices

428
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:49,323
that the real estate demands.
Right?

429
00:14:49,323 --> 00:14:52,979
Last month, I suggested selling
inventory at a reduced rate.

430
00:14:52,979 --> 00:14:53,980
And we tried that, but...

431
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:55,633
He's right. We tried it.

432
00:14:55,633 --> 00:14:58,288
I can't reduce any more.
I'll lose all my artists.

433
00:14:58,288 --> 00:14:59,942
- Can't do it.
- Uh-huh.

434
00:14:59,942 --> 00:15:02,249
Got this young guy right now.

435
00:15:02,249 --> 00:15:03,772
I'm telling you, there's heat--

436
00:15:03,772 --> 00:15:06,296
am I right, Cy?-- all around
this kid. -Yeah. -Oh.

437
00:15:06,296 --> 00:15:08,516
Dev's great. People love him.

438
00:15:08,516 --> 00:15:09,517
Really good.

439
00:15:09,517 --> 00:15:10,910
Has he sold yet? No.

440
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:14,174
I-Is that whose work
is out there now?

441
00:15:14,174 --> 00:15:16,480
Yeah.

442
00:15:17,133 --> 00:15:18,308
Oh. Yeah.

443
00:15:18,308 --> 00:15:19,483
Look, here's the thing--

444
00:15:19,483 --> 00:15:21,529
you guys...
you guys are in debt.

445
00:15:21,529 --> 00:15:24,184
And at some point,
the faucet gets turned off.

446
00:15:24,184 --> 00:15:26,186
Look, we've been having
these meetings once a month

447
00:15:26,186 --> 00:15:28,971
for, what, seven months,
and there's been no improvement.

448
00:15:28,971 --> 00:15:31,060
In fact,
things have gotten worse.

449
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:35,238
I'd say, without a new show--
and a fruitful one--

450
00:15:35,238 --> 00:15:38,502
you are looking at, I don't--
like, a few more months.

451
00:15:38,502 --> 00:15:39,677
Tops.

452
00:15:39,677 --> 00:15:40,896
I'm sorry.

453
00:15:40,896 --> 00:15:42,680
When we first moved in,
it was us,

454
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:44,508
a tattoo parlor and a toy store.

455
00:15:44,508 --> 00:15:47,947
Now it's just, you know,
sneaker shops,

456
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:50,079
and half the block
is an Apple Store.

457
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:51,907
MALE VOICE [over phone]: All of
our agents are currently busy

458
00:15:51,907 --> 00:15:53,691
assisting other callers.

459
00:15:53,691 --> 00:15:55,998
Press one to have an agent
call you back. -Representative.

460
00:15:57,130 --> 00:15:58,914
Sorry, I didn't catch that.

461
00:15:58,914 --> 00:16:00,263
Would you like an agent
to call you back?

462
00:16:00,263 --> 00:16:02,483
God, this thing is defective!

463
00:16:02,483 --> 00:16:04,746
Sorry, I didn't catch that.

464
00:16:04,746 --> 00:16:07,053
Would you like an agent to
call you back? -Representative!

465
00:16:07,053 --> 00:16:10,056
- Sorry, I didn't catch that.
-  -

466
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:13,668
Sorry, I didn't catch that.

467
00:16:14,016 --> 00:16:15,452
Dad, I can't talk right now.

468
00:16:15,452 --> 00:16:17,063
I've been on the line
with the delivery service

469
00:16:17,063 --> 00:16:19,195
delivering my changing table
for 45 minutes.

470
00:16:19,195 --> 00:16:20,370
I have to call you back.

471
00:16:20,370 --> 00:16:21,545
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

472
00:16:21,545 --> 00:16:22,982
Just give me a second.
Honey, hey,

473
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:24,635
I really need your help
tonight, pal.

474
00:16:24,635 --> 00:16:25,810
I'm in a bind here.

475
00:16:25,810 --> 00:16:26,898
There's a thing at school.

476
00:16:26,898 --> 00:16:28,770
Uh, it slipped my mind.

477
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:31,294
Tali can't stay, and I need
somebody to watch the kids.

478
00:16:31,294 --> 00:16:33,557
Could you watch the kids for me
tonight, please?

479
00:16:33,557 --> 00:16:35,646
Gracie, come on.

480
00:16:35,646 --> 00:16:37,300
- What do you say?
- No.

481
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:39,215
No. I'm sorry. No.

482
00:16:39,215 --> 00:16:40,695
- Really?
- Yeah. Really.

483
00:16:40,695 --> 00:16:41,826
Why not?

484
00:16:41,826 --> 00:16:45,004
Because I, you know,
have, like...

485
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:46,788
a million things going on.

486
00:16:46,788 --> 00:16:50,400
I don't know. I-I have work
and I'm pregnant and...

487
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,706
Okay.

488
00:16:51,706 --> 00:16:53,316
I-I don't want to.

489
00:16:53,316 --> 00:16:55,101
Wait. Look,

490
00:16:55,101 --> 00:16:57,712
I really need your help, babe.
Really, honestly.

491
00:16:57,712 --> 00:17:01,150
I mean, I-I never ask you
for your help, do I? I don't.

492
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:03,848
I mean, I'm under
such stressful-- Oh, God.

493
00:17:03,848 --> 00:17:06,634
You have no idea how stressful
the circumstances are right now.

494
00:17:06,634 --> 00:17:08,897
Honestly. So I just need you--

495
00:17:08,897 --> 00:17:10,159
It'll be for a couple of hours.

496
00:17:10,159 --> 00:17:12,466
That's it--
couple of hours, okay?

497
00:17:12,466 --> 00:17:14,424
This is me begging you.

498
00:17:14,424 --> 00:17:15,817
I'm begging now, okay?

499
00:17:15,817 --> 00:17:18,472
I'm begging you,
my daughter, for help.

500
00:17:18,472 --> 00:17:19,560
'Kay?

501
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:21,127
How often do I ever do this?

502
00:17:21,127 --> 00:17:22,302
Like, when do I do this?

503
00:17:22,302 --> 00:17:23,564
Do you really want me
to answer that?

504
00:17:23,564 --> 00:17:24,913
Lately. Lately.

505
00:17:24,913 --> 00:17:26,480
I was just gonna say "lately."

506
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,611
I was just gonna say it.

507
00:17:27,611 --> 00:17:29,178
I was gonna say,
"When-when-when d--

508
00:17:29,178 --> 00:17:32,225
lately I asked you... honey?"

509
00:17:35,924 --> 00:17:38,274
How long are you pregnant for?

510
00:17:38,274 --> 00:17:39,580
Nine months.

511
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:40,885
Ten, technically.

512
00:17:40,885 --> 00:17:42,496
And how much longer
until you're finished?

513
00:17:42,496 --> 00:17:44,411
Three and a half more months.

514
00:17:44,411 --> 00:17:46,674
Do you know if it's
a boy or a girl? -No.

515
00:17:46,674 --> 00:17:49,024
- We want to be surprised.
- Why?

516
00:17:49,024 --> 00:17:52,288
Pete does.
Actually, I really want to know.

517
00:17:52,288 --> 00:17:54,116
What do you hope it is?

518
00:17:54,116 --> 00:17:56,727
A girl, obviously.

519
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:58,120
Sorry.

520
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:59,078
I get it.

521
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:00,383
Right.

522
00:18:00,383 --> 00:18:02,081
Are you excited to be a mom
or not really?

523
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:03,604
Yes.

524
00:18:03,604 --> 00:18:06,172
Okay, so, uh, you guys...

525
00:18:06,172 --> 00:18:07,434
must be hungry.

526
00:18:07,434 --> 00:18:09,914
Uh, let's see,
what's your dad got here?

527
00:18:09,914 --> 00:18:12,091
I bet he's got, like,
pasta with butter and cheese.

528
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:14,397
Why do you always say
"your dad"?

529
00:18:14,397 --> 00:18:16,269
Isn't he all of our dads?

530
00:18:16,269 --> 00:18:19,272
Well, I'm 27 years older
than you,

531
00:18:19,272 --> 00:18:22,013
which is basically unheard of
for siblings.

532
00:18:22,013 --> 00:18:24,103
Except maybe in L.A.

533
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:26,279
Wait, you're 36?

534
00:18:26,279 --> 00:18:27,454
Is your mom good at math?

535
00:18:27,454 --> 00:18:28,803
'Cause you definitely
didn't inherit

536
00:18:28,803 --> 00:18:29,891
that skill from my father.

537
00:18:29,891 --> 00:18:30,979
Our father.

538
00:18:30,979 --> 00:18:33,982
Oh, right. Okay.

539
00:19:23,727 --> 00:19:24,815
Hey.

540
00:19:24,815 --> 00:19:25,990
Oh.

541
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:27,470
Hi, Daddy. Oh.

542
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:29,211
I don't-- I don't know
why I just called you that.

543
00:19:29,211 --> 00:19:30,691
Hey, Dad. Wha-What-What are
you doing home so early?

544
00:19:30,691 --> 00:19:32,388
What's up? -Uh, you know me.
I ducked out early.

545
00:19:32,388 --> 00:19:33,998
- Look at you. How you doing?
- Hi.

546
00:19:33,998 --> 00:19:36,653
- Good.
- Man, oh, man, oh, man.

547
00:19:36,653 --> 00:19:37,785
Get bigger every day.

548
00:19:37,785 --> 00:19:39,265
You look fantastic, kiddo.

549
00:19:39,265 --> 00:19:40,875
Really. Look so good.

550
00:19:40,875 --> 00:19:42,137
- Hope it's a girl.
- Dad.

551
00:19:42,137 --> 00:19:43,312
I do.

552
00:19:43,312 --> 00:19:44,705
Sorry. It'd be great.

553
00:19:44,705 --> 00:19:46,489
Can't believe
my baby's having a baby.

554
00:19:46,489 --> 00:19:47,795
- Yeah.
- You hungry?

555
00:19:47,795 --> 00:19:50,189
I'm starved.
Do I have any food?

556
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:52,582
So, you go
to things like this now?

557
00:19:52,582 --> 00:19:54,671
Parent/teacher conferences?

558
00:19:54,671 --> 00:19:55,890
Yeah.
What are you talking about?

559
00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:57,761
I did all that stuff with you.

560
00:19:57,761 --> 00:20:00,199
- Never.
- Oh, come on.

561
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:01,461
Geez, Grace, give me a break.

562
00:20:01,461 --> 00:20:03,376
What do you want from me?
I did my best.

563
00:20:03,376 --> 00:20:06,074
Do we not have
a good relationship?

564
00:20:06,466 --> 00:20:08,381
We do.

565
00:20:08,381 --> 00:20:10,992
It's just that when I was
Billie and Mose's age,

566
00:20:10,992 --> 00:20:12,254
I hardly saw you.

567
00:20:12,254 --> 00:20:14,996
There were trips to London
and Switzerland,

568
00:20:14,996 --> 00:20:16,650
Miami, New York.

569
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:17,999
I mean...

570
00:20:17,999 --> 00:20:19,870
you practically lived
at the gallery.

571
00:20:19,870 --> 00:20:22,264
I mean, it's okay, but let's
be honest-- I was there, too.

572
00:20:22,264 --> 00:20:24,397
We went to New York together,
you and I, remember?

573
00:20:24,397 --> 00:20:26,703
Once. We went once.

574
00:20:26,703 --> 00:20:28,227
Yeah! Remember,
we had such a nice time?

575
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:30,577
We went to see,
uh, uh, the Rockettes.

576
00:20:30,577 --> 00:20:32,100
I took you to Serendipity.

577
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:34,494
Am I not the president
of your fan club?

578
00:20:34,494 --> 00:20:36,931
I am.
That piece you wrote about

579
00:20:36,931 --> 00:20:39,542
the death of arthouse theaters,
that was great writing.

580
00:20:39,542 --> 00:20:41,152
I showed it
to everybody in the office.

581
00:20:41,152 --> 00:20:43,329
They loved it.
Did Cy email you?

582
00:20:43,329 --> 00:20:45,113
Yes, yes, he did.

583
00:20:45,113 --> 00:20:46,375
You know what,
this conversation's

584
00:20:46,375 --> 00:20:47,333
really stressing me out.

585
00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:48,551
I got, I got work I have to do.

586
00:20:48,551 --> 00:20:50,074
I have to clean out
the coat closet

587
00:20:50,074 --> 00:20:51,598
to make room
for all the baby stuff.

588
00:20:51,598 --> 00:20:52,947
My back hurts like hell.

589
00:20:52,947 --> 00:20:54,862
And I have a human head
wedged between my ribs.

590
00:20:54,862 --> 00:20:56,559
So if you'll excuse me.

591
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:58,866
- Ah.
- You know what?

592
00:20:58,866 --> 00:21:00,520
You must really love what you do

593
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:02,304
to be away
from your kids to do it,

594
00:21:02,304 --> 00:21:04,132
because I'm already wondering,
do I really care

595
00:21:04,132 --> 00:21:05,829
about the dumb shit
that I write about?

596
00:21:05,829 --> 00:21:07,701
And I haven't even met
my kid yet.

597
00:21:07,701 --> 00:21:09,268
I might not even like them.

598
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:11,008
What do you mean, dumb shit?
You don't write dumb shit.

599
00:21:11,008 --> 00:21:12,401
You're a great writer.
What are you talking about?

600
00:21:12,401 --> 00:21:14,403
Why? Are you thinking
about quitting?

601
00:21:14,403 --> 00:21:16,100
You're the senior
entertainment writer.

602
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:17,754
I know my title, Dad, thank you.

603
00:21:17,754 --> 00:21:19,321
You know,
forget I said anything.

604
00:21:19,321 --> 00:21:22,498
And... you're welcome
for watching your kids.

605
00:21:22,498 --> 00:21:23,891
Where are you going?
Have some pi--

606
00:21:23,891 --> 00:21:25,284
I was just gonna say thank you.

607
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:26,372
If you gave me a chance,

608
00:21:26,372 --> 00:21:27,721
I was just about
to say thank you.

609
00:21:27,721 --> 00:21:29,157
What,
does Pete want you to quit?

610
00:21:29,157 --> 00:21:31,290
You know,
what is your deal with Pete?

611
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:33,335
Huh? He's a fantastic person.

612
00:21:33,335 --> 00:21:34,858
He's next-level reliable,

613
00:21:34,858 --> 00:21:37,252
he's sweet,
he's a brilliant doctor.

614
00:21:37,252 --> 00:21:39,602
He's not the type of guy
that would ever,

615
00:21:39,602 --> 00:21:41,691
ever ask me to quit my job.

616
00:21:41,691 --> 00:21:43,780
- I...
- What?

617
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:45,695
- What? What?
- Nothing.

618
00:21:45,695 --> 00:21:47,610
I mean, I-- I mean...

619
00:21:47,610 --> 00:21:49,699
To be honest, he's an ear,
nose and throat doctor.

620
00:21:49,699 --> 00:21:52,049
- But that's okay. I mean, not--
-  Oh, my God.

621
00:21:52,049 --> 00:21:54,008
So an ear, nose
and throat doctor isn't

622
00:21:54,008 --> 00:21:56,184
a cool enough job for you,
huh, Mr. Cool Guy?

623
00:21:56,184 --> 00:21:57,794
No, no, no, look, I do.

624
00:21:57,794 --> 00:22:00,710
I like him very much, I do.
I really like him.

625
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:02,582
I do.

626
00:22:02,582 --> 00:22:04,888
He's, he's a nerd,
and that's okay, it's...

627
00:22:04,888 --> 00:22:06,455
- Some people are nerds.
- Okay, you know what?

628
00:22:06,455 --> 00:22:08,065
No, I'm not gonna
get stressed out.

629
00:22:08,065 --> 00:22:10,372
It's not healthy, and I'm
already way too stressed out!

630
00:22:10,372 --> 00:22:12,592
Okay, okay.
Now, don't get so stressed.

631
00:22:12,592 --> 00:22:14,333
Just relax. We're just talking.

632
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:16,465
You know what, you...

633
00:22:16,465 --> 00:22:19,207
you have a complex
about traditional things.

634
00:22:19,207 --> 00:22:20,861
It's not a direct offense to you

635
00:22:20,861 --> 00:22:22,863
that I don't follow
your La bohème school

636
00:22:22,863 --> 00:22:24,560
of living life in reverse.

637
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:26,823
I want order.
I wanted to get married

638
00:22:26,823 --> 00:22:28,869
and start a family
and, I don't know!

639
00:22:28,869 --> 00:22:30,871
Okay, maybe, maybe
I'm just future tripping here

640
00:22:30,871 --> 00:22:32,916
and thinking that I don't want
to leave my baby

641
00:22:32,916 --> 00:22:36,267
to go write profile pieces
on some TikTokers.

642
00:22:36,267 --> 00:22:38,182
Okay, you're not making
any sense right now.

643
00:22:38,182 --> 00:22:39,706
Because first you said
you don't even know

644
00:22:39,706 --> 00:22:41,403
if you're gonna like the kid,
and now you're

645
00:22:41,403 --> 00:22:43,579
quitting your job just
to spend more time with them.

646
00:22:43,579 --> 00:22:46,060
- So it's-it's--
-  I'm processing.

647
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:48,018
- Okay.
- This is my process.

648
00:22:48,018 --> 00:22:49,977
- I get it, I get it, okay.
- I'm just processing.

649
00:22:49,977 --> 00:22:51,979
Wait, I get it now, okay,
just don't get stressed.

650
00:22:51,979 --> 00:22:54,460
What do you want me to do
to help? -Just help!

651
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:56,549
Dad, don't ask, just do.

652
00:22:56,549 --> 00:22:58,333
Okay, I'm-I'm just better

653
00:22:58,333 --> 00:23:00,640
when I'm told how to help.
I'm just...

654
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:03,382
Oh, my God, I wish I could
record this conversation

655
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:05,384
and play it back
for my therapist.

656
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:08,038
See, does Pete know
how funny you are?

657
00:23:08,038 --> 00:23:09,779
- Yes, he does.
- Okay.

658
00:23:09,779 --> 00:23:11,433
- Do you want to really help?
- Yes.

659
00:23:11,433 --> 00:23:13,522
Okay, come shopping with me
for some baby stuff.

660
00:23:13,522 --> 00:23:14,958
Pete's on call all week.

661
00:23:14,958 --> 00:23:16,743
And-and-and the stores are
crowded on the weekends.

662
00:23:16,743 --> 00:23:18,701
And I just don't have
the patience to go by myself.

663
00:23:18,701 --> 00:23:20,921
Done. Done. Set. Play--

664
00:23:20,921 --> 00:23:22,923
It's, it's kind of far away.

665
00:23:22,923 --> 00:23:25,186
No, I want to go, I-- Honey?

666
00:23:25,186 --> 00:23:27,057
I love hanging out with you,
so I'm good.

667
00:23:27,057 --> 00:23:29,103
Let's go. I'll just go
no matter how far it is.

668
00:23:29,103 --> 00:23:31,018
- Any day next week.
- Okay.

669
00:23:31,018 --> 00:23:32,889
Tuesday, can't.

670
00:23:32,889 --> 00:23:36,153
And, uh, I'm not sure
about Thursday, but just...

671
00:23:36,153 --> 00:23:38,417
Just-just email me your
availability, okay? -Okay.

672
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:39,853
- Okay, good, can't wait.
- Okay.

673
00:23:39,853 --> 00:23:41,637
- Love you.
- Okay, great.

674
00:23:41,637 --> 00:23:43,247
You've never looked better ever.

675
00:23:45,641 --> 00:23:47,513
-Hey, Dad?
-Hmm?

676
00:23:47,513 --> 00:23:51,560
Did you see our self-portraits
in the art room at school?

677
00:23:53,127 --> 00:23:54,476
I did.

678
00:23:54,476 --> 00:23:56,391
I thought they were
fantastic, really.

679
00:23:56,391 --> 00:23:59,960
Your use of sunlight
is, ooh, so sweet.

680
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:01,701
And, Mose,
you've got this kind of

681
00:24:01,701 --> 00:24:03,093
Basquiat-ish vibe going,

682
00:24:03,093 --> 00:24:04,747
which I'm totally digging.

683
00:24:04,747 --> 00:24:06,575
Very abstract. Very good.
Very, very good.

684
00:24:06,575 --> 00:24:08,664
Hold on, I got to get this.

685
00:24:08,664 --> 00:24:11,188
Hey. What'd you think?

686
00:24:11,188 --> 00:24:14,061
Tell me that piece is not you.

687
00:24:14,061 --> 00:24:15,845
Huh? Really?

688
00:24:15,845 --> 00:24:17,891
-Dad?
- Really?

689
00:24:17,891 --> 00:24:19,370
Me, I think it's stunning.

690
00:24:19,370 --> 00:24:20,981
Dad, what's "rehab"?

691
00:24:20,981 --> 00:24:23,462
Gonna m--

692
00:24:24,767 --> 00:24:26,856
H-Hold on a minute.

693
00:24:26,856 --> 00:24:28,467
Yeah, ring you back.

694
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:30,425
Bye. Excuse me?

695
00:24:30,425 --> 00:24:32,471
A girl at school said
that her mom said that

696
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:35,430
that's where our mom is.
Is that true?

697
00:24:36,170 --> 00:24:38,781
No, it's not true.
It's absolutely not true.

698
00:24:38,781 --> 00:24:41,697
Who told you that? What girl?
I'm gonna call her mother.

699
00:24:41,697 --> 00:24:44,483
I'm just gonna Google it
if you don't tell me.

700
00:24:49,183 --> 00:24:50,706
Okay.

701
00:24:50,706 --> 00:24:52,665
Okay, look.

702
00:24:52,665 --> 00:24:56,495
Rehab is a place where people go
who aren't feeling well.

703
00:24:57,234 --> 00:24:59,410
They go there
to get to feel better.

704
00:24:59,410 --> 00:25:01,108
But that's not
where your mom is.

705
00:25:01,108 --> 00:25:03,023
Mom's in St. Louis.

706
00:25:03,458 --> 00:25:05,504
She told us yesterday.

707
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:07,157
When did you talk
to your mother?

708
00:25:07,157 --> 00:25:09,072
She calls us after school.

709
00:25:09,072 --> 00:25:12,380
Why is that weird?

710
00:25:14,425 --> 00:25:17,385
It's not weird. It's not weird.

711
00:25:17,385 --> 00:25:19,605
It's not weird at all.
It's good.

712
00:25:19,605 --> 00:25:21,563
It's good.

713
00:25:21,563 --> 00:25:23,522
Come on, come on, shortstop.

714
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:25,436
Grab your, uh,
grab your backpack.

715
00:25:25,436 --> 00:25:27,482
We got to get going.

716
00:25:28,352 --> 00:25:30,572
What are you gonna be
for Halloween this year, Mose?

717
00:25:30,572 --> 00:25:33,880
-The alien/car from Forza.
-What?

718
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,055
That doesn't even make sense.

719
00:25:35,055 --> 00:25:37,884
Dad, can we go
Halloween shopping soon?

720
00:25:37,884 --> 00:25:40,190
Halloween?
It was just summer.

721
00:25:40,190 --> 00:25:41,670
- Holy mackerel.
- Come on.

722
00:25:41,670 --> 00:25:42,845
We're gonna be late for school.

723
00:25:42,845 --> 00:25:44,543
- Okay.
- Our school is

724
00:25:44,543 --> 00:25:45,848
- really strict about tardiness.
- Okay, okay, okay.

725
00:25:45,848 --> 00:25:48,895
Okay, let's go.

726
00:25:48,895 --> 00:25:51,027
Hi, Cy. It's Billie.
Can he call you back?

727
00:25:51,027 --> 00:25:52,681
We're late for school.

728
00:25:52,681 --> 00:25:54,378
How'd you get my phone?

729
00:25:54,378 --> 00:25:56,163
Hey, ask him if he saw
the article in the Times.

730
00:25:56,163 --> 00:25:58,905
- Did you see the... He saw.
- Okay.

731
00:25:58,905 --> 00:26:02,473
Hey, tell him to have Jonny
get a number on the daughter.

732
00:26:02,473 --> 00:26:04,475
Can you have Jonny get
a number on the daughter?

733
00:26:04,475 --> 00:26:05,781
Name?

734
00:26:05,781 --> 00:26:08,392
- Lola, Lola Thompson.
- Lola, Lola Thompson.

735
00:26:08,392 --> 00:26:10,525
All right, he'll be in
in an hour. Bye.

736
00:26:10,525 --> 00:26:12,788
- Okay, let's go.
- Where are our lunches?

737
00:26:12,788 --> 00:26:14,529
You can't get them at school?

738
00:26:14,529 --> 00:26:16,270
I pay all this money
for the school

739
00:26:16,270 --> 00:26:17,401
and they don't feed you?

740
00:26:17,401 --> 00:26:18,664
If you ever took us to school,

741
00:26:18,664 --> 00:26:20,143
you'd know that
they only give us lunches

742
00:26:20,143 --> 00:26:21,841
on very special days
like Taco Tuesdays.

743
00:26:21,841 --> 00:26:24,060
And today is not
one of those days.

744
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:25,496
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, come on.

745
00:26:25,496 --> 00:26:26,585
Just get in the car. Let's go.

746
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:28,151
We'll pick something up
on the way.

747
00:26:29,326 --> 00:26:31,067
Hey, come on. Hey.

748
00:26:31,067 --> 00:26:32,591
Sorry we're late. We're...

749
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:34,462
Oh. Sorry. 'Scuse me.
All right. -Bye. -Bye. See you.

750
00:26:34,462 --> 00:26:36,420
Yeah, hey, hi.
We're late a little bit. -Hi.

751
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:37,770
Um, these are my kids.

752
00:26:37,770 --> 00:26:39,815
- They're in, uh, third grade.
- Fourth grade.

753
00:26:39,815 --> 00:26:41,600
They're in, uh, fo--
Uh, they're in, uh...

754
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,384
What's your teacher's name?
The one with the hair?

755
00:26:43,384 --> 00:26:45,734
Uh, Miss G, you mean? -Yeah,
they're in Miss G's class.

756
00:26:45,734 --> 00:26:47,040
Um, do you have a doctor's note?

757
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:49,172
Uh, yeah, no, we're-we're just,

758
00:26:49,172 --> 00:26:50,609
you know,
good old-fashioned late.

759
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:53,046
I'm gonna have to mark them
both as tardy then.

760
00:26:53,046 --> 00:26:55,396
- Dad! -
-No, no, this is my fault.

761
00:26:55,396 --> 00:26:56,702
This is on me.
This is my fault.

762
00:26:56,702 --> 00:26:57,964
I was reading a thing
in the paper.

763
00:26:57,964 --> 00:26:59,313
I forgot about the lunches.

764
00:26:59,313 --> 00:27:01,532
And, uh, next thing you know,
boom, it's 8:00.

765
00:27:01,532 --> 00:27:02,708
So...

766
00:27:02,708 --> 00:27:04,274
I'm sorry.

767
00:27:04,274 --> 00:27:05,754
That's not how this works.

768
00:27:05,754 --> 00:27:07,364
Tardy.

769
00:27:07,364 --> 00:27:08,583
No.

770
00:27:08,583 --> 00:27:10,150
It's 8:07.

771
00:27:10,150 --> 00:27:11,804
That's not-- That's really not
even late, seven minutes.

772
00:27:11,804 --> 00:27:13,632
Come on, you've never been late

773
00:27:13,632 --> 00:27:15,111
for a lunch
or something like that?

774
00:27:15,111 --> 00:27:17,200
- It's not a big deal. Just...
- Hi, hi, hi!

775
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,942
- Sorry we're late!
- Hey! Oh, not a problem, Terry.

776
00:27:19,942 --> 00:27:21,770
Welcome, Alexander.

777
00:27:21,770 --> 00:27:24,033
- Hey, Alex.
-  Okay, come here.

778
00:27:24,033 --> 00:27:25,600
Come here, buddy.
Okay. Sorry, buddy.

779
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:28,211
- I'm so sorry.
- What's with this guy?

780
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:30,170
Alex is epileptic.

781
00:27:30,170 --> 00:27:31,780
He's always at the doctor.

782
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:32,955
Ah.

783
00:27:33,956 --> 00:27:35,915
I love you so much.

784
00:27:43,226 --> 00:27:44,706
- Hey.
- Hey. How you doing?

785
00:27:44,706 --> 00:27:46,360
- Oh, hey. Hi. How are you?
- Hey.

786
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:47,796
Boy, they are strict
around here, aren't they?

787
00:27:47,796 --> 00:27:49,319
Yeah, they're pretty cool
with us,

788
00:27:49,319 --> 00:27:51,365
but they can be kind of nuts
about tardiness. -Yeah.

789
00:27:51,365 --> 00:27:53,367
I'm Terry, by the way.
Alexander's in class

790
00:27:53,367 --> 00:27:55,064
- with Billie and Mose.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

791
00:27:55,064 --> 00:27:57,414
- I know. Yeah. Hi. Andy.
- Yeah. Yeah, I, uh,

792
00:27:57,414 --> 00:27:58,851
saw you briefly
at the Back-to-School Night

793
00:27:58,851 --> 00:28:01,027
- but didn't get a chance to...
- Yeah.

794
00:28:01,027 --> 00:28:02,506
Hey.

795
00:28:02,506 --> 00:28:04,595
If I'm out-of-bounds here,
tell me, but...

796
00:28:04,595 --> 00:28:07,816
uh, Billie told me about
your little guy, Alexander.

797
00:28:07,816 --> 00:28:10,340
Mm. -And, uh, sorry to hear.
That-That's rough, man.

798
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:12,473
- Oh.
- I've got...

799
00:28:12,473 --> 00:28:13,735
Oh, geez. I'm sorry.

800
00:28:13,735 --> 00:28:15,345
No, it's okay. I'm-I'm...

801
00:28:15,345 --> 00:28:16,695
I'm fine.

802
00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:18,653
- I'm so sorry.
- No, I'm fine.

803
00:28:18,653 --> 00:28:20,568
Hold on a minute.
Hold on a minute. -I'm okay.

804
00:28:20,568 --> 00:28:22,657
Here. Here. -Everything sets
me off. I'm an actor, so, uh...

805
00:28:22,657 --> 00:28:24,398
- Oh. Yeah. It's clean.
- Oh. Thank you. That's-that's...

806
00:28:25,834 --> 00:28:27,444
Thank you. I'm an actor,
so all my emotions

807
00:28:27,444 --> 00:28:29,272
- are, like, right here.
- Oh, sure. Yeah.

808
00:28:29,272 --> 00:28:30,534
What kind of stuff do you do?

809
00:28:30,534 --> 00:28:31,971
Little bit of everything.

810
00:28:31,971 --> 00:28:34,190
Mostly graphic design.

811
00:28:34,190 --> 00:28:36,715
- Yeah. You know. Yeah.
- Sure. It's hard.

812
00:28:36,715 --> 00:28:38,455
Yeah, I do graphic design
when I'm not shooting something,

813
00:28:38,455 --> 00:28:41,720
and... lately,
I'm never shooting anything.

814
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,983
Oh, geez. Oh, man.
There I go again. -No.

815
00:28:43,983 --> 00:28:46,246
This is so embarrassing.
-No. No.

816
00:28:46,246 --> 00:28:47,464
- Look at that.
- Oh, wow.

817
00:28:47,464 --> 00:28:48,944
- Two of 'em, right there.
- Very good.

818
00:28:48,944 --> 00:28:51,468
- Once again, clean.
- Thank you.

819
00:28:51,468 --> 00:28:55,255
I've just-- I've been off
since my husband left us.

820
00:28:55,255 --> 00:28:57,692
I'm sorry to hear that.
That's... -Thank you.

821
00:28:57,692 --> 00:28:58,737
How long has that been?

822
00:28:58,737 --> 00:28:59,738
Three years.

823
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:01,522
- Three? Ah.
- Yeah.

824
00:29:01,522 --> 00:29:03,002
And he's only seen Alex one time

825
00:29:03,002 --> 00:29:04,351
- since he left.
- In three years?

826
00:29:04,351 --> 00:29:05,874
Yeah. Can you believe that?

827
00:29:05,874 --> 00:29:07,746
That's-- Sorry,
I don't know the guy,

828
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:09,486
but that's kind of schmucky.

829
00:29:10,313 --> 00:29:11,706
Yes. Thank you.

830
00:29:11,706 --> 00:29:12,663
It is schmucky.

831
00:29:12,663 --> 00:29:14,622
- Yeah.
- Yeah. It was all just

832
00:29:14,622 --> 00:29:16,276
"too much" for him.

833
00:29:16,276 --> 00:29:18,495
But Alex and I are good.

834
00:29:18,495 --> 00:29:20,193
We're in a total groove
with everything.

835
00:29:21,281 --> 00:29:22,891
We got him
on the right medication.

836
00:29:22,891 --> 00:29:25,633
His doctor is A-plus-plus.

837
00:29:25,633 --> 00:29:27,330
- Oh, good.
- But, um...

838
00:29:27,330 --> 00:29:29,158
Yeah, but then someone asks you
how your day's going

839
00:29:29,158 --> 00:29:32,292
and suddenly you're crying
at drop-off. -Yeah.

840
00:29:34,598 --> 00:29:36,818
Well...

841
00:29:37,210 --> 00:29:38,994
Uh...

842
00:29:39,386 --> 00:29:40,779
I'm actually...

843
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:42,650
kind of in the same boat.

844
00:29:42,650 --> 00:29:44,347
Little bit.

845
00:29:44,347 --> 00:29:45,871
- Oh.
- Yeah. Yeah.

846
00:29:45,871 --> 00:29:48,743
- Naomi and I are... Oh, yeah.
- Shut up.

847
00:29:48,743 --> 00:29:51,354
Yeah. -Ah. That's why
she missed Back-to-School Night?

848
00:29:51,354 --> 00:29:52,529
Well, sort of.

849
00:29:52,529 --> 00:29:55,837
She-She's, uh...
seeing somebody.

850
00:29:55,837 --> 00:29:57,056
- Oh.
- Yeah.

851
00:29:57,056 --> 00:29:58,753
- Professional help.
- Oh.

852
00:29:58,753 --> 00:30:00,407
There's a little bit
of a drug thing.

853
00:30:00,407 --> 00:30:02,757
- Drug issue. Ish.
- Oh.

854
00:30:02,757 --> 00:30:03,845
You know, she...

855
00:30:03,845 --> 00:30:06,456
- she was doing drugs, so...
- Coke.

856
00:30:06,456 --> 00:30:07,762
- No, no, no.
- Oh.

857
00:30:07,762 --> 00:30:09,198
No.

858
00:30:09,198 --> 00:30:10,330
No. Prescription pills.

859
00:30:10,330 --> 00:30:11,810
Oh.

860
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:13,159
I'm the husband.
I don't even know about it.

861
00:30:13,159 --> 00:30:14,595
- Right?
- Well...

862
00:30:14,595 --> 00:30:16,684
No, no. I mean,
what's that say about me?

863
00:30:16,684 --> 00:30:17,990
I don't-- Is this too much?

864
00:30:17,990 --> 00:30:19,818
- 'Cause I'm... Should I...
- No. Oh, God, no.

865
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:21,167
- Seriously, though.
- No, come on.

866
00:30:21,167 --> 00:30:22,516
I'm the guy--
I'm supposed to know--

867
00:30:22,516 --> 00:30:24,779
I mean, tell me, am I in denial?

868
00:30:24,779 --> 00:30:26,781
Am I just dumb? I don't know.

869
00:30:26,781 --> 00:30:28,522
Yeah, yeah. Want to sit?

870
00:30:28,522 --> 00:30:30,045
Let's sit. Absolutely.

871
00:30:30,045 --> 00:30:32,352
Maybe she just needed a break
from it all, you know?

872
00:30:32,352 --> 00:30:33,701
From me. You know?

873
00:30:33,701 --> 00:30:36,138
You should see
the rehab center, by the way.

874
00:30:36,138 --> 00:30:37,226
It's like the Four Seasons.

875
00:30:37,226 --> 00:30:38,749
Who do you think's
paying for that?

876
00:30:40,316 --> 00:30:42,231
-Well, she's taking
the steps towards recovery.

877
00:30:42,231 --> 00:30:43,493
That's... that's good, right?

878
00:30:43,493 --> 00:30:45,365
Families overcome these things.

879
00:30:45,365 --> 00:30:47,193
Yeah, I know.
But she didn't clue me in.

880
00:30:47,193 --> 00:30:48,890
I had no idea.
She didn't let me know

881
00:30:48,890 --> 00:30:51,719
what she was going through,
and now I'm the bad guy.

882
00:30:51,719 --> 00:30:54,635
I got to tell you something--
you're real easy to talk to.

883
00:30:54,635 --> 00:30:55,723
Has anybody ever told you that?

884
00:30:57,159 --> 00:30:58,857
Thanks. That's, um...

885
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:01,207
How-how does she sound
when you talk to her?

886
00:31:01,207 --> 00:31:03,687
Every time I call, they won't
let me-- I can't see her.

887
00:31:03,687 --> 00:31:06,429
They won't let me talk to her.
I'm completely in the dark.

888
00:31:06,429 --> 00:31:08,301
Mm.

889
00:31:08,301 --> 00:31:10,651
My advice,
you know, keep trying.

890
00:31:10,651 --> 00:31:13,480
- Yeah.
- Keep calling.

891
00:31:14,002 --> 00:31:17,049
I got to go. Um...

892
00:31:17,701 --> 00:31:19,965
- Good luck.
- Oh. Thanks. Yeah.

893
00:31:19,965 --> 00:31:21,314
- Take care, Andy.
- Yeah, sure.

894
00:31:21,314 --> 00:31:22,924
- You got this, mama.
- Okay.

895
00:31:22,924 --> 00:31:25,144
- Thanks.
-  All right.

896
00:31:32,412 --> 00:31:35,415
I'm sorry for not being there
for you more.

897
00:31:35,415 --> 00:31:37,852
I'm sorry, okay?

898
00:31:37,852 --> 00:31:39,375
I just want to say
I hope you're getting

899
00:31:39,375 --> 00:31:40,550
the help you need.

900
00:31:40,550 --> 00:31:42,988
I'll be here for you.
And I miss you.

901
00:31:44,250 --> 00:31:45,904
Hello?

902
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:47,949
Naomi?

903
00:31:48,558 --> 00:31:49,951
Hello? Naomi.

904
00:31:51,474 --> 00:31:53,259
Okay. Okay.

905
00:31:53,259 --> 00:31:54,695
I-I know it's you.

906
00:31:54,695 --> 00:31:55,957
Uh...

907
00:31:55,957 --> 00:31:57,916
The kids told me...

908
00:31:57,916 --> 00:32:02,355
you call 'em after school,
so I came home to talk to you.

909
00:32:04,009 --> 00:32:05,662
Okay.

910
00:32:06,054 --> 00:32:07,969
I can tell
you're not gonna say anything.

911
00:32:07,969 --> 00:32:10,363
That-That's okay.
I'll-I'll do all the talking.

912
00:32:10,363 --> 00:32:12,104
Okay?

913
00:32:12,104 --> 00:32:13,757
Okay. I came to see you.

914
00:32:13,757 --> 00:32:15,455
I'm sure... sure you know that.

915
00:32:15,455 --> 00:32:17,848
And I've called every day
and left messages.

916
00:32:17,848 --> 00:32:20,503
I don't know...
if you've gotten them or not.

917
00:32:20,503 --> 00:32:24,420
Actually,
pretty sure you have, but...

918
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:27,162
I just wanted
to say some things, okay?

919
00:32:27,162 --> 00:32:28,859
I want to say...

920
00:32:28,859 --> 00:32:32,211
I'm sorry for not being there
for you more,

921
00:32:32,211 --> 00:32:35,692
for not even knowing
to be there for you more.

922
00:32:35,692 --> 00:32:39,348
I know things have been weird
between us recently,

923
00:32:39,348 --> 00:32:42,395
and things have just... been off

924
00:32:42,395 --> 00:32:44,049
and I... I ignored it.

925
00:32:44,049 --> 00:32:46,573
I've been wrapped up
in the gallery

926
00:32:46,573 --> 00:32:49,576
and all the stuff
that's going on there,

927
00:32:49,576 --> 00:32:51,708
which is only getting worse,
by the way.

928
00:32:53,449 --> 00:32:56,757
And I've been...
I've been in my own universe.

929
00:32:56,757 --> 00:32:58,585
I know I have.

930
00:32:58,585 --> 00:33:00,979
And I'm sorry. I apologize.

931
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:03,982
I hope you're getting
the help that you need.

932
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:06,680
And I'm here
whenever you're ready.

933
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:09,770
I'll just be here.

934
00:33:09,770 --> 00:33:12,338
Okay? I'll be here for you.

935
00:33:12,338 --> 00:33:15,080
The kids miss you like crazy.

936
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:17,256
And I miss you.

937
00:33:17,952 --> 00:33:20,607
Naomi.

938
00:33:21,521 --> 00:33:22,870
Okay, I get it. I get it.

939
00:33:22,870 --> 00:33:24,437
You're not...
you're not gonna--

940
00:33:24,437 --> 00:33:26,961
you're not gonna say anything.
That's okay.

941
00:33:27,353 --> 00:33:28,615
So you can...

942
00:33:28,615 --> 00:33:32,749
you can call back for the kids,
and, uh...

943
00:33:32,749 --> 00:33:34,229
I-I won't answer.

944
00:33:34,229 --> 00:33:36,710
I promise I won't pick up, okay?

945
00:33:36,710 --> 00:33:39,191
O-Okay. Okay.

946
00:33:39,191 --> 00:33:41,541
I love you.

947
00:33:41,541 --> 00:33:43,325
Okay.

948
00:33:51,333 --> 00:33:53,814
Okay, can you just explain
why you're not speaking with me?

949
00:33:53,814 --> 00:33:55,207
MOSE [laughs]: Oh, my God.

950
00:33:55,207 --> 00:33:56,773
Okay, okay, okay. Watch this.

951
00:33:56,773 --> 00:33:58,166
Hey, guys,
where are you? I'm leaving.

952
00:33:58,166 --> 00:33:59,776
But you need
to press that button on top.

953
00:33:59,776 --> 00:34:01,039
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
-I know.

954
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:02,214
- Not inside. Not inside.
- I'm pressing it.

955
00:34:02,214 --> 00:34:03,954
Now make it go, like,
around the lamp.

956
00:34:03,954 --> 00:34:04,781
- Make it come down. Come on.
-Okay. Watch.

957
00:34:04,781 --> 00:34:06,044
Okay, okay.

958
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:07,306
Let's go.
Who got you that thing anyway?

959
00:34:07,306 --> 00:34:09,003
You and Mom did.
Last Christmas.

960
00:34:09,003 --> 00:34:10,396
- Ooh.
-Billie.

961
00:34:10,396 --> 00:34:12,311
- Come on, come on.
- Oh, my God! -Relax.

962
00:34:12,311 --> 00:34:13,703
Bring it down.
Give me the remote.

963
00:34:13,703 --> 00:34:15,879
- We're having fun.
- I've got to go.

964
00:34:15,879 --> 00:34:17,794
Billie! Hand me the remote!

965
00:34:18,404 --> 00:34:20,275
-  You made me do that.
- Billie!

966
00:34:20,275 --> 00:34:22,060
What is wrong with you?
What did I just say?

967
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:24,018
Do you know how valuable
that was? -It doesn't matter.

968
00:34:24,018 --> 00:34:26,455
We're not even allowed to touch
anything in this house anyway.

969
00:34:26,455 --> 00:34:28,718
Yes, you are.
You're just not allowed to fly

970
00:34:28,718 --> 00:34:30,590
a fucking drone in my house.

971
00:34:30,590 --> 00:34:32,157
You finally said it.
Your house.

972
00:34:32,157 --> 00:34:34,115
It's your house!

973
00:34:34,115 --> 00:34:36,378
I want Mom.
She likes us more than you do.

974
00:34:36,378 --> 00:34:39,816
Really?
Well, Mom's not here, is she?

975
00:34:49,478 --> 00:34:51,393
Billie, I'm sorry.

976
00:34:51,393 --> 00:34:55,223
I-I'm sorry I raised my voice
and I used the f-word.

977
00:34:55,223 --> 00:34:56,877
I was frustrated.

978
00:34:56,877 --> 00:34:58,183
I yelled.
I shouldn't have done it.

979
00:34:58,183 --> 00:35:01,099
Will you accept my apology, please?

980
00:35:03,057 --> 00:35:05,494
Come on, honey.
I have to leave soon.

981
00:35:07,235 --> 00:35:10,238
Hey, Tali, do you think
you can get the door?

982
00:35:10,238 --> 00:35:11,718
What does it look like
I'm doing?

983
00:35:14,721 --> 00:35:17,027
Bill, the food's here.

984
00:35:17,376 --> 00:35:19,117
- Please. Honey.
- Just go!

985
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:20,596
You go out every night!

986
00:35:20,596 --> 00:35:22,120
I have to go to work!

987
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,904
Somebody has to support the...

988
00:35:23,904 --> 00:35:26,863
generations of children
who hate me.

989
00:35:27,255 --> 00:35:29,431
Bill, please.

990
00:35:32,956 --> 00:35:35,872
Hey.
How 'bout if I stay in tonight?

991
00:35:35,872 --> 00:35:38,179
We can watch a movie together.

992
00:35:38,179 --> 00:35:40,181
How's that sound?

993
00:35:44,838 --> 00:35:46,666
So great.

994
00:35:47,188 --> 00:35:49,973
I can't believe
you guys have never seen this.

995
00:35:49,973 --> 00:35:52,759
Where would we have seen it?

996
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:56,632
RICK [on screen]:
My letter of transit?

997
00:35:56,632 --> 00:35:57,981
I could use a trip.

998
00:35:57,981 --> 00:35:59,809
It doesn't make
any difference about our bet.

999
00:35:59,809 --> 00:36:01,463
You still owe me 10,000 francs.

1000
00:36:01,463 --> 00:36:03,987
And that 10,000 francs
should pay our expenses.

1001
00:36:03,987 --> 00:36:05,293
Our expenses?

1002
00:36:05,293 --> 00:36:07,339
-Mm-hmm.
-Louis,

1003
00:36:07,339 --> 00:36:11,212
I think this is the beginning
of a beautiful friendship.

1004
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:15,651
Come on. It's perfect.

1005
00:36:18,088 --> 00:36:20,613
So, what'd you think?

1006
00:36:20,613 --> 00:36:21,918
I mean, they didn't even
end up together.

1007
00:36:21,918 --> 00:36:23,485
That's just, like... crazy.

1008
00:36:23,485 --> 00:36:26,314
I-I know.
That's what makes it a,

1009
00:36:26,314 --> 00:36:28,316
you know, really good
love story, though, you know?

1010
00:36:28,316 --> 00:36:29,796
It's kind of, uh...

1011
00:36:29,796 --> 00:36:31,798
what they call "bittersweet,"
you know?

1012
00:36:31,798 --> 00:36:33,974
Hey, look...

1013
00:36:33,974 --> 00:36:37,195
relationships aren't easy, pal.

1014
00:36:37,673 --> 00:36:40,241
How do you deal with having
so many girls in your life?

1015
00:36:41,721 --> 00:36:44,637
Not very well, my friend.

1016
00:36:44,637 --> 00:36:47,074
Not very well.

1017
00:36:47,553 --> 00:36:50,817
It's past your bedtime.
Let's go.

1018
00:36:50,817 --> 00:36:53,428
- D-Dad?
- Yeah?

1019
00:36:54,516 --> 00:36:57,476
Is Mom ever coming back?

1020
00:36:57,476 --> 00:36:58,955
Of course she is.

1021
00:36:58,955 --> 00:37:00,305
Of course she's coming back.

1022
00:37:00,305 --> 00:37:02,655
Why would you ask me that?

1023
00:37:03,090 --> 00:37:06,224
Just a feeling, I guess.

1024
00:37:07,616 --> 00:37:10,315
Hey, man, your mom loves you

1025
00:37:10,315 --> 00:37:14,101
way, way, way too much
not to come back.

1026
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:18,497
Um... We're doing all right,
though, right?

1027
00:37:19,106 --> 00:37:21,021
Yeah.

1028
00:37:21,021 --> 00:37:23,545
We're doing pretty good.

1029
00:37:27,854 --> 00:37:29,159
All right.

1030
00:37:29,159 --> 00:37:32,075
Help me load up, uh,
the belle of the ball.

1031
00:37:32,075 --> 00:37:34,295
Okay.

1032
00:38:22,256 --> 00:38:23,649
Dad, will you close that
behind you?

1033
00:38:23,649 --> 00:38:25,825
- Yeah, yeah. Yeah.
- Thank you. Oof.

1034
00:38:25,825 --> 00:38:27,348
Here, let me get that.
Let me get those--

1035
00:38:27,348 --> 00:38:28,915
Dad, I'm fine.
I'm fine, I'm fine.

1036
00:38:28,915 --> 00:38:31,918
- All right.
-  Oh.

1037
00:38:31,918 --> 00:38:34,181
Hey, do you have any food?
Like, any hummus or anything?

1038
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:36,575
What? What are you--

1039
00:38:36,575 --> 00:38:38,620
Hello?

1040
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:40,535
- What's up?
- Hey, it's me and Jonny,

1041
00:38:40,535 --> 00:38:44,060
and we have some good news
and some bad news.

1042
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:45,235
Okay, give me the, uh...

1043
00:38:45,235 --> 00:38:46,802
- give me the good news.
-Okay.

1044
00:38:46,802 --> 00:38:48,108
No, give me the bad news, right?

1045
00:38:48,108 --> 00:38:49,370
- All right, okay.
- Never mind.

1046
00:38:49,370 --> 00:38:50,763
- Just give me the good news.
- Well, so...

1047
00:38:50,763 --> 00:38:52,242
- Yeah. Go ahead.
- All right.

1048
00:38:52,242 --> 00:38:53,635
- Okay. So the good...
- Hey, hold-hold on a second.

1049
00:38:53,635 --> 00:38:55,333
- Bill, give me a second.
- Grace.

1050
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:57,030
- What'd I say?
- Bill.

1051
00:38:57,030 --> 00:38:58,901
- Sorry.
- So many kids.

1052
00:38:58,901 --> 00:39:00,642
Who can keep track? -I know.
I'll-- Hold, hold on a second.

1053
00:39:00,642 --> 00:39:02,992
Hey. Hey. Hold on. Hold on.

1054
00:39:02,992 --> 00:39:06,213
- Yeah. Okay, go ahead.
-Okay. Okay.

1055
00:39:06,213 --> 00:39:09,477
Well, the good news is that
Theresa Thompson's daughter

1056
00:39:09,477 --> 00:39:13,176
isn't meeting with anybody
and she's not taking any calls.

1057
00:39:13,176 --> 00:39:14,700
That's good news?

1058
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:16,963
She's performing tonight
in Hollywood. She's a singer.

1059
00:39:16,963 --> 00:39:19,705
We think you should go
down there and talk to her

1060
00:39:19,705 --> 00:39:21,184
and see what you can do.

1061
00:39:21,184 --> 00:39:22,969
Just show up? I mean--
What kind of singer is she?

1062
00:39:22,969 --> 00:39:25,319
Uh... well, it's...

1063
00:39:25,319 --> 00:39:27,582
looks like it's
some kind of a jazz club.

1064
00:39:27,582 --> 00:39:28,975
Oh. Cool.

1065
00:39:28,975 --> 00:39:30,237
Yeah, I can do that.

1066
00:39:30,237 --> 00:39:31,281
That'd be fun.

1067
00:39:31,281 --> 00:39:34,197
Uh...
Okay, what's the bad news?

1068
00:39:36,156 --> 00:39:40,160
I spoke with Dev earlier,
and, uh...

1069
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:42,075
he's leaving us, Andy.

1070
00:39:42,075 --> 00:39:43,859
I'm so sorry.

1071
00:39:44,556 --> 00:39:46,993
I-I didn't expect that.

1072
00:39:46,993 --> 00:39:48,342
What did he say, exactly?

1073
00:39:48,342 --> 00:39:49,996
Why didn't he call me?

1074
00:39:49,996 --> 00:39:51,824
Well, he's nervous. He's young.

1075
00:39:51,824 --> 00:39:53,434
First shows
are always tough, Cy.

1076
00:39:53,434 --> 00:39:55,567
We've been through this
a million times.

1077
00:39:55,567 --> 00:39:56,698
We work hard for that kid,

1078
00:39:56,698 --> 00:39:58,134
and then he just
leaves us like that?

1079
00:39:58,134 --> 00:39:59,614
Did you tell him about the ad

1080
00:39:59,614 --> 00:40:01,094
we took out in the L.A. Times?

1081
00:40:01,094 --> 00:40:02,748
I told him about it.

1082
00:40:02,748 --> 00:40:05,011
But who's he gonna blame for
the work not selling? Himself?

1083
00:40:05,011 --> 00:40:07,883
Look, go down
to this jazz thing,

1084
00:40:07,883 --> 00:40:09,407
talk to Lola Thompson.

1085
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:10,756
I know you.

1086
00:40:10,756 --> 00:40:13,411
And I know
you can make this happen.

1087
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:20,809
What's wrong?

1088
00:40:20,809 --> 00:40:22,158
Nothing.

1089
00:40:22,158 --> 00:40:23,290
Absolutely nothing.

1090
00:40:23,290 --> 00:40:25,118
I have to go
to this thing tonight.

1091
00:40:25,118 --> 00:40:26,946
Jazz club.
Check out this singer.

1092
00:40:26,946 --> 00:40:28,295
- It's for work.
- Mm-hmm.

1093
00:40:28,295 --> 00:40:29,470
Supposed to be
a very hip little club.

1094
00:40:29,470 --> 00:40:30,732
You want to come with me?

1095
00:40:30,732 --> 00:40:32,995
Your place looks fantastic,
by the way.

1096
00:40:32,995 --> 00:40:34,432
These chairs, are they new?

1097
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:37,260
Nope. I've had them
for about a year.

1098
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:39,001
- Really?
- Just, uh, you never come over.

1099
00:40:39,001 --> 00:40:40,438
Stop it.
I come over all the time.

1100
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:41,743
- Yeah, okay.
- I do.

1101
00:40:41,743 --> 00:40:42,831
What do you say? You and me,

1102
00:40:42,831 --> 00:40:44,093
we'll go out
on the town tonight.

1103
00:40:44,093 --> 00:40:45,225
You and me, doing the town.

1104
00:40:45,225 --> 00:40:47,009
- Mm.
- Starts at 10:00. It'll be fun.

1105
00:40:47,009 --> 00:40:49,098
There's supposed to be
some good sushi over there.

1106
00:40:49,751 --> 00:40:51,884
10:00's a little rough
for me lately, Dad.

1107
00:40:51,884 --> 00:40:53,363
- Right.
- Yeah.

1108
00:40:53,363 --> 00:40:54,756
- Sorry. You're right.
- Yeah.

1109
00:40:54,756 --> 00:40:56,192
Well, what are you
gonna do for dinner?

1110
00:40:56,192 --> 00:40:57,803
- Why don't you--
- Hello, mi familia.

1111
00:40:57,803 --> 00:40:59,108
Hey, Pete. So how you doing?

1112
00:40:59,108 --> 00:41:01,459
- Hey, Andy.
- Hi, bub.

1113
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:02,982
Thank you so much
for taking her shopping.

1114
00:41:02,982 --> 00:41:04,244
I'm thrilled
I didn't have to go.

1115
00:41:04,244 --> 00:41:05,463
- Sure.
-Uh, really?

1116
00:41:05,463 --> 00:41:06,942
Yeah. I'm just saying.

1117
00:41:06,942 --> 00:41:08,944
You look very beautiful,
by the way. -Me?

1118
00:41:08,944 --> 00:41:10,032
-Uh-huh.
-You're crazy.

1119
00:41:10,032 --> 00:41:11,599
I am not.

1120
00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:12,948
Also, I picked up
from that Greek place you like.

1121
00:41:12,948 --> 00:41:14,254
Yeah?

1122
00:41:14,254 --> 00:41:16,386
- And the good froyo.
- Oh!

1123
00:41:16,386 --> 00:41:18,084
Yum.

1124
00:41:18,084 --> 00:41:20,216
Andy, I wish I knew
you were still here.

1125
00:41:20,216 --> 00:41:21,696
I would've gotten more kebabs.

1126
00:41:21,696 --> 00:41:22,915
No, I'm good. I'm--

1127
00:41:22,915 --> 00:41:24,177
I'll grab something to eat
on the way.

1128
00:41:24,177 --> 00:41:26,440
Uh, hey. This was fun today.

1129
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:27,746
Wait-- No. Um...

1130
00:41:27,746 --> 00:41:29,443
- Here, I got it.
- No, stay.

1131
00:41:29,443 --> 00:41:31,401
Hold on.
Uh, Dad, why don't you stay?

1132
00:41:31,401 --> 00:41:32,925
We can-- we can
figure this out. -Yeah.

1133
00:41:32,925 --> 00:41:34,404
- There's enough food.
- Nah. Nah. I'll be good.

1134
00:41:34,404 --> 00:41:35,928
I'm good. Really.

1135
00:41:35,928 --> 00:41:37,320
Okay. Um...

1136
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:39,758
Well... have fun.

1137
00:41:39,758 --> 00:41:42,369
Don't worry about me.
I'm good. Thanks, kiddo.

1138
00:41:42,369 --> 00:41:45,415
- See ya.
- Later, Pete.

1139
00:41:54,773 --> 00:41:56,035
- Hey.
- Oh, hi.

1140
00:41:56,035 --> 00:41:57,689
- Ticket booth's over there.
- Okey doke.

1141
00:41:57,689 --> 00:41:59,473
- Thanks.
- Mm-hmm.

1142
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:02,520
- Hi.
- Hi.

1143
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:05,479
How are you? Hey, is this
the, uh, Lola Thompson show?

1144
00:42:05,479 --> 00:42:07,263
Uh...

1145
00:42:07,263 --> 00:42:09,352
Wait. Are you...

1146
00:42:09,352 --> 00:42:10,745
Lola...

1147
00:42:10,745 --> 00:42:12,312
Is-- Are you with her, or...

1148
00:42:12,312 --> 00:42:13,792
No, she's... Is she perform--

1149
00:42:13,792 --> 00:42:15,141
She's supposed
to be performing. -Wait.

1150
00:42:15,141 --> 00:42:16,621
Uh, yeah. Probably.

1151
00:42:16,621 --> 00:42:17,970
Uh, I think.

1152
00:42:17,970 --> 00:42:19,145
Yeah, actually, Lola Thompson,

1153
00:42:19,145 --> 00:42:20,494
- yes, she's right there.
- There it is.

1154
00:42:20,494 --> 00:42:21,626
Oh, good, good. Now what?

1155
00:42:21,626 --> 00:42:23,497
- I mean, do we, uh...
- Oh, it's $20.

1156
00:42:23,497 --> 00:42:24,846
- There you go. There you go.
- Yeah.

1157
00:42:24,846 --> 00:42:26,805
But 25 if online.

1158
00:42:26,805 --> 00:42:28,633
No. I... we're...

1159
00:42:28,633 --> 00:42:30,069
Here we are, paying now.

1160
00:42:30,069 --> 00:42:32,114
And it's
"a night of feminist works."

1161
00:42:32,114 --> 00:42:33,681
Enjoy.

1162
00:42:33,681 --> 00:42:34,856
Oh.

1163
00:42:34,856 --> 00:42:37,859
Yay, women supporting women.

1164
00:42:40,296 --> 00:42:41,863
I've had an amazing time.

1165
00:42:41,863 --> 00:42:43,952
I feel like
our periods are gonna be

1166
00:42:43,952 --> 00:42:45,301
all synced up after tonight.

1167
00:42:46,564 --> 00:42:48,870
Thank you so much.
I'm out of here, guys.

1168
00:42:48,870 --> 00:42:50,568
You guys are fantastic.

1169
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:52,352
Enjoy the rest of your night.
I should stop being desperate.

1170
00:42:52,352 --> 00:42:55,573

-  This is...
-Uh, excuse me. Uh, Lola?

1189
00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:04,685
Hi.

1190
00:44:04,685 --> 00:44:06,774
- Hey.
- Hey. Uh... First of all,

1191
00:44:06,774 --> 00:44:08,167
that was
a really interesting show.

1192
00:44:08,167 --> 00:44:09,559
I wasn't, you know,
ready for that.

1193
00:44:09,559 --> 00:44:11,823
- But it was great.
- Thank you.

1194
00:44:11,823 --> 00:44:13,781
- Andy Goodrich.
- Thank you.

1195
00:44:13,781 --> 00:44:15,217
- Nice to meet you, Andy.
- Yeah.

1196
00:44:15,217 --> 00:44:17,132
I was hoping we could...

1197
00:44:17,132 --> 00:44:18,525
chat for a little bit.

1198
00:44:18,525 --> 00:44:20,832
Well, I was on my way out, so...

1199
00:44:20,832 --> 00:44:23,965
I own the Goodrich Gallery,
here in L.A.

1200
00:44:23,965 --> 00:44:26,315
Oh. Okay. Yeah.

1201
00:44:26,315 --> 00:44:30,885
I was wondering if we could
talk about your mother Theresa.

1202
00:44:30,885 --> 00:44:33,671
Your-- your mother,
comma, Theresa,

1203
00:44:33,671 --> 00:44:36,848
- not Mother Teresa.
- I got you. Um...

1204
00:44:36,848 --> 00:44:38,240
I'm so sorry,

1205
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:39,807
but I'm not really talking
to people just yet.

1206
00:44:39,807 --> 00:44:42,375
- Yeah.
- You know? I need...

1207
00:44:42,375 --> 00:44:45,508
just a little while
to think things through.

1208
00:44:45,508 --> 00:44:46,945
She just passed.

1209
00:44:46,945 --> 00:44:49,643
Yeah, no, I get it.
Totally understand, really.

1210
00:44:49,643 --> 00:44:51,384
I just want to tell you

1211
00:44:51,384 --> 00:44:55,127
I am such a fan
of your mom's work,

1212
00:44:55,127 --> 00:44:56,694
like, for decades,

1213
00:44:56,694 --> 00:44:58,173
and she wasn't discovered till,

1214
00:44:58,173 --> 00:44:59,784
you know,
really late in her career.

1215
00:44:59,784 --> 00:45:01,699
Yeah, well, she was lucky.

1216
00:45:01,699 --> 00:45:03,788
She always said,
"If you're a female artist,

1217
00:45:03,788 --> 00:45:05,267
- you're bound..."
-"Bound to be dead

1218
00:45:05,267 --> 00:45:08,401
before you make any money."

1219
00:45:09,402 --> 00:45:11,056
Yeah, I know.

1220
00:45:11,056 --> 00:45:13,058
She said that to me, too.

1221
00:45:13,058 --> 00:45:14,799
Hmm.

1222
00:45:14,799 --> 00:45:16,104
You know,
I remember the first time

1223
00:45:16,104 --> 00:45:17,758
I came across
your mother's work.

1224
00:45:17,758 --> 00:45:20,587
I immediately bought
this really nice little piece,

1225
00:45:20,587 --> 00:45:22,589
and I really wanted
to represent her,

1226
00:45:22,589 --> 00:45:24,939
but, you know,
she had already gone elsewhere.

1227
00:45:24,939 --> 00:45:26,593
I'm telling you,
here's what I think we do:

1228
00:45:26,593 --> 00:45:28,943
we-we raise her visibility,
you know,

1229
00:45:28,943 --> 00:45:31,641
which in turn's gonna
raise her price,

1230
00:45:31,641 --> 00:45:33,078
but she deserves it,
I'm telling you--

1231
00:45:33,078 --> 00:45:34,427
Sorry.

1232
00:45:34,427 --> 00:45:36,472
My mind is going
a million miles an hour.

1233
00:45:36,472 --> 00:45:38,779
I'm so excited
talking about this. -Okay.

1234
00:45:38,779 --> 00:45:41,434
How do I know you're not gonna
just tag her into a show

1235
00:45:41,434 --> 00:45:42,609
with other Black female artists?

1236
00:45:42,609 --> 00:45:44,742
Solo presentation only. Look.

1237
00:45:44,742 --> 00:45:46,874
I know we're only
a little boutique gallery,

1238
00:45:46,874 --> 00:45:48,658
but that's to your advantage.

1239
00:45:48,658 --> 00:45:50,486
You're gonna get approached
by everyone,

1240
00:45:50,486 --> 00:45:52,097
if you haven't already.

1241
00:45:52,097 --> 00:45:53,620
Have you already?

1242
00:45:53,620 --> 00:45:56,754
Uh... no one else was
the only man at my show tonight.

1243
00:45:56,754 --> 00:46:00,496
I go to every feminist works
night I can get to.

1244
00:46:00,496 --> 00:46:01,846
Okay.

1245
00:46:01,846 --> 00:46:04,022
Last thing
before I cut you loose.

1246
00:46:04,022 --> 00:46:05,545
Everywhere else,

1247
00:46:05,545 --> 00:46:07,416
you're just gonna be one of,
you know,

1248
00:46:07,416 --> 00:46:09,636
ten or 20 different estates.

1249
00:46:09,636 --> 00:46:12,204
You're just gonna be
on the director's to-do list.

1250
00:46:12,204 --> 00:46:15,468
If you come with me, you get me.

1251
00:46:15,947 --> 00:46:18,863
Okay, this has been
the longest day,

1252
00:46:18,863 --> 00:46:22,170
and right now my mind is just
on a hot shower, so...

1253
00:46:22,170 --> 00:46:24,782
- I will come to your gallery.
- Cool.

1254
00:46:24,782 --> 00:46:27,132
And we will meet more formally.

1255
00:46:27,132 --> 00:46:28,829
That is more than
I've offered anyone.

1256
00:46:28,829 --> 00:46:29,961
Cool.

1257
00:46:29,961 --> 00:46:33,791
And yes, there are others.

1258
00:46:35,096 --> 00:46:36,794
How many others? I'm joking.

1259
00:46:38,534 --> 00:46:39,971
Okay, Halloween costumes!

1260
00:46:39,971 --> 00:46:41,799
Let's do this.

1261
00:46:41,799 --> 00:46:43,061
Okay, you guys know
what you want?

1262
00:46:43,061 --> 00:46:44,149
Can we divide and conquer?

1263
00:46:44,149 --> 00:46:45,933
-Ah!

1264
00:46:45,933 --> 00:46:47,892
- Nice, nice.
- Wow.

1265
00:46:47,892 --> 00:46:49,067
Anyway, what was I saying?

1266
00:46:49,067 --> 00:46:50,285
- You're a loser.
- Yes.

1267
00:46:50,285 --> 00:46:52,374
Eh... not my words, yours.

1268
00:46:52,374 --> 00:46:54,246
- And you're not.
- Right.

1269
00:46:54,246 --> 00:46:57,423
Well, I'm told
time heals all wounds, but...

1270
00:46:57,423 --> 00:47:00,643
I'm just sitting here, waiting,
and no healing.

1271
00:47:00,643 --> 00:47:01,775
You know?

1272
00:47:01,775 --> 00:47:03,211
You just got
to get out there, man.

1273
00:47:03,211 --> 00:47:05,692
Get out in the world more.
Look at you.

1274
00:47:05,692 --> 00:47:07,912
Really nice guy,
good-looking dude,

1275
00:47:07,912 --> 00:47:09,304
great dad.

1276
00:47:09,304 --> 00:47:11,002
Just gotta power through
this thing, man.

1277
00:47:11,002 --> 00:47:12,655
- Come on.
- Thanks, Andy.

1278
00:47:12,655 --> 00:47:15,528
How about you? How's
your healing process going?

1279
00:47:15,528 --> 00:47:16,877
Not good.

1280
00:47:16,877 --> 00:47:19,314
Still haven't heard from Naomi.

1281
00:47:19,314 --> 00:47:20,750
I don't know. Hate it.

1282
00:47:20,750 --> 00:47:23,362
I was over at my daughter
and her husband's house

1283
00:47:23,362 --> 00:47:24,972
the other day.

1284
00:47:24,972 --> 00:47:27,235
You know, it was--
I don't know, it was odd.

1285
00:47:27,235 --> 00:47:30,151
It made me feel like, uh...

1286
00:47:31,631 --> 00:47:32,980
...lonely, actually.

1287
00:47:32,980 --> 00:47:34,242
Yeah.

1288
00:47:34,242 --> 00:47:35,591
- Yeah, lonely.
-Dad! Dad, Dad!

1289
00:47:35,591 --> 00:47:37,376
Look at this Boba Fett costume!

1290
00:47:37,376 --> 00:47:38,681
Cool!

1291
00:47:38,681 --> 00:47:40,640
There's a jet pack
and arm guards

1292
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:42,120
and an ammunition belt!

1293
00:47:42,120 --> 00:47:44,949
Aw. Man, this is
really, really great.

1294
00:47:44,949 --> 00:47:46,689
You know what, bud?
It's a little pricy.

1295
00:47:46,689 --> 00:47:48,604
I bet we could find something
even cooler than this.

1296
00:47:48,604 --> 00:47:50,868
Oh. Okay.

1297
00:47:50,868 --> 00:47:51,999
Ooh, I don't think so.

1298
00:47:51,999 --> 00:47:55,089
Love it. I love it.
Good find, dude.

1299
00:47:55,089 --> 00:47:56,743
Excellent find.
Stick it in the bag.

1300
00:47:56,743 --> 00:47:58,310
-Yes.
- That's going with us. -Ah. No.

1301
00:47:58,310 --> 00:47:59,572
Andy, you don't have to
do that. -No, it's on me.

1302
00:47:59,572 --> 00:48:01,182
- No...
- Forget about it, man.

1303
00:48:01,182 --> 00:48:02,836
- Don't worry about it.
- We'll get something else.

1304
00:48:02,836 --> 00:48:03,750
- He'll wear it one time.
- It's so not a big deal.

1305
00:48:03,750 --> 00:48:04,577
Don't...

1306
00:48:04,577 --> 00:48:07,014
Thank you. That's so nice.

1307
00:48:07,014 --> 00:48:08,581
Have you thought about

1308
00:48:08,581 --> 00:48:11,540
telling the kids
the truth about Naomi?

1309
00:48:11,540 --> 00:48:13,499
I mean, I'm sure
they already have a hunch.

1310
00:48:13,499 --> 00:48:15,066
They're so intuitive, you know?

1311
00:48:15,066 --> 00:48:18,199
They-they know so little,
but they pick up on so much.

1312
00:48:18,199 --> 00:48:20,680
- They're funny like that.
- I-I have.

1313
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:24,771
It just... seems like the end
of something for them, I think.

1314
00:48:24,771 --> 00:48:26,860
You know? I mean, they still
believe in the Tooth Fairy.

1315
00:48:26,860 --> 00:48:28,731
They don't even like it
when their meat touches

1316
00:48:28,731 --> 00:48:30,255
their vegetables on their plate.

1317
00:48:30,255 --> 00:48:31,604
- Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad!
-Hey, hey, hey, hey!

1318
00:48:31,604 --> 00:48:33,475
- What do we got? What do we got?
- Uh-oh. Uh-oh.

1319
00:48:33,475 --> 00:48:36,217
'Cause I got about five minutes
of this place left in me.

1320
00:48:36,217 --> 00:48:38,306
Okay. I'm going to be
a demented zombie,

1321
00:48:38,306 --> 00:48:40,395
and Mose is gonna be
a dead alien ghost.

1322
00:48:40,395 --> 00:48:41,614
It's gonna be so awesome.

1323
00:48:41,614 --> 00:48:43,181
Okay. Okay.

1324
00:48:43,181 --> 00:48:45,052
I think I have a better idea.

1325
00:48:45,052 --> 00:48:46,575
Trick or treat!

1326
00:48:46,575 --> 00:48:48,969
WOMAN [laughs]:
Wow, what do we have here?

1327
00:48:48,969 --> 00:48:54,453
A hip old man
and a beautiful young señorita.

1328
00:48:54,453 --> 00:48:56,934
Oh, look! Boba Fett!

1329
00:49:00,328 --> 00:49:01,764
Okay. Give it back.

1330
00:49:01,764 --> 00:49:04,376
Okay, wait. Okay,
I'll trade you for this candy.

1331
00:49:04,376 --> 00:49:06,856
Hey. Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa. Let me look here.

1332
00:49:06,856 --> 00:49:07,945
Dad, I already checked.
No nuts.

1333
00:49:07,945 --> 00:49:09,294
- Thank you.
- Let me double-check.

1334
00:49:09,294 --> 00:49:10,382
I'll give you this one.

1335
00:49:13,559 --> 00:49:15,213
- Boo!
-  Oh, my God.

1336
00:49:15,213 --> 00:49:17,998
Andy, you scared me.

1337
00:49:17,998 --> 00:49:19,782
This house is incredible.

1338
00:49:19,782 --> 00:49:21,219
Yeah. Thanks.

1339
00:49:21,219 --> 00:49:22,960
- It's a nice house.
- It's so nice

1340
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:24,309
and cozy and chic and...

1341
00:49:24,309 --> 00:49:26,137
- Yeah.
- ...like, perfect.

1342
00:49:26,137 --> 00:49:27,747
How long have you lived here?

1343
00:49:27,747 --> 00:49:30,663
Since, uh, 17? No, 18 years.

1344
00:49:30,663 --> 00:49:32,230
- Oh, wow.
- Yeah. 18 years.

1345
00:49:32,230 --> 00:49:33,840
Hey, you drink whiskey?

1346
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:36,538
Uh, you know, I'm more of
a rosé fella, but yeah, sure.

1347
00:49:36,538 --> 00:49:38,627
- Thank you.
-  There you go.

1348
00:49:38,627 --> 00:49:42,457
Yeah. I bought it right after
my, uh, divorce from Ann.

1349
00:49:42,457 --> 00:49:43,719
Oh, Ann.

1350
00:49:43,719 --> 00:49:46,157
That's your
older daughter's mom, right?

1351
00:49:46,157 --> 00:49:47,985
- Yeah. Right.
- How long were you two married?

1352
00:49:47,985 --> 00:49:49,812
Uh, 14 years.

1353
00:49:49,812 --> 00:49:51,771
- Hmm.
- She's in the art world, too.

1354
00:49:51,771 --> 00:49:55,079
Hmm. -She's, uh, the director
of the Walton Museum downtown.

1355
00:49:55,079 --> 00:49:56,863
- Oh.
- Yeah.

1356
00:49:56,863 --> 00:49:58,647
Museum director.
That's a big job.

1357
00:49:58,647 --> 00:49:59,822
Yeah, it is.

1358
00:49:59,822 --> 00:50:01,955
Actually really knows
the art world.

1359
00:50:01,955 --> 00:50:03,913
She's pretty brilliant,
I gotta say.

1360
00:50:03,913 --> 00:50:06,612
Which, uh, explains...

1361
00:50:07,743 --> 00:50:09,136
...probably why
she left me, but...

1362
00:50:10,659 --> 00:50:13,314
You know,
this is actually really good.

1363
00:50:13,314 --> 00:50:14,663
Yeah, it should be.

1364
00:50:14,663 --> 00:50:16,926
- 31-year-old bottle there, pal.
- What?

1365
00:50:16,926 --> 00:50:18,711
Andy, are you nuts?

1366
00:50:18,711 --> 00:50:19,842
Don't waste this on me.

1367
00:50:19,842 --> 00:50:21,583
I wouldn't even know
the difference.

1368
00:50:21,583 --> 00:50:23,542
Sure you would.
You're a man of taste, I think.

1369
00:50:23,542 --> 00:50:27,546
And seem to be a guy who enjoys
the finer things in life.

1370
00:50:27,546 --> 00:50:30,984
Anyway, just enjoy it.

1371
00:50:30,984 --> 00:50:33,856
How often do I get to, you know,

1372
00:50:33,856 --> 00:50:35,380
drink with an elf?

1373
00:50:35,380 --> 00:50:37,469
Mm.

1374
00:50:37,469 --> 00:50:39,949
- Okay, wow.
- Is that a good okay?

1375
00:50:39,949 --> 00:50:41,168
Good okay? Bad okay?

1376
00:50:41,168 --> 00:50:42,387
- Good, good...?
- Well...

1377
00:50:42,387 --> 00:50:43,605
Fuck!

1378
00:50:43,605 --> 00:50:45,520
Oh, fuck!

1379
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:48,262
Oh... Oh...

1380
00:50:48,262 --> 00:50:50,003
Let me start by saying sorry.

1381
00:50:50,003 --> 00:50:52,484
-  Oh, my God.
- Dude. So not a big deal.

1382
00:50:52,484 --> 00:50:54,051
You know, I just-- I've been
out of the game so long.

1383
00:50:54,051 --> 00:50:55,530
Sure! -And I-I thought
the roaring fire

1384
00:50:55,530 --> 00:50:56,966
and the sexy music

1385
00:50:56,966 --> 00:50:58,707
and the 30-year-old whiskey...
I just, I don't--

1386
00:50:58,707 --> 00:51:00,144
I-I thought things were
getting romantic? -Right.

1387
00:51:00,144 --> 00:51:02,320
So, I could see a guy go,
"Yeah, he's..." but...

1388
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:04,670
By the way, let me ask--
Do I seem gay, though?

1389
00:51:04,670 --> 00:51:06,802
Do I? -I am
very uncomfortable right now.

1390
00:51:06,802 --> 00:51:09,022
- No, dude. I'm telling you--
- Anyway, um...

1391
00:51:09,022 --> 00:51:10,241
Great seeing you, man.

1392
00:51:10,241 --> 00:51:13,113
Alex! Let's go!

1393
00:51:13,113 --> 00:51:14,375
You know what?

1394
00:51:14,375 --> 00:51:16,377
For the record,
I'm way too young for you.

1395
00:51:16,377 --> 00:51:18,075
Well, that's hardly
the issue here, pal.

1396
00:51:18,075 --> 00:51:21,121
You told me to get out there.
Meet new people.

1397
00:51:21,121 --> 00:51:22,731
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
but I didn't mean me.

1398
00:51:22,731 --> 00:51:23,993
I wasn't talking about me.

1399
00:51:23,993 --> 00:51:25,343
It was that 30-year-old whiskey.

1400
00:51:25,343 --> 00:51:27,388
Shame on you for serving me
that spoiled shit!

1401
00:51:27,388 --> 00:51:29,608
Dude, you had a little sip.
It wasn'’'t that big a deal.

1402
00:51:29,608 --> 00:51:31,566
No, no.
I said a silent "l'chaim"

1403
00:51:31,566 --> 00:51:32,872
and I drank the whole thing.

1404
00:51:32,872 --> 00:51:35,353
This is so embarrassing.

1405
00:51:35,353 --> 00:51:38,573
And I am dressed like an elf!

1406
00:51:38,573 --> 00:51:40,967
Alex! We have got to go!

1407
00:51:40,967 --> 00:51:42,490
Dude, you have
got to relax, man.

1408
00:51:42,490 --> 00:51:43,839
Seriously. Look.

1409
00:51:43,839 --> 00:51:45,189
My wife's in rehab,

1410
00:51:45,189 --> 00:51:47,060
my business has just
gone to shit...

1411
00:51:47,060 --> 00:51:48,496
Some dude kisses me.

1412
00:51:48,496 --> 00:51:50,977
At this point, really,
you want to know the truth?

1413
00:51:50,977 --> 00:51:53,545
Almost doesn't fucking faze me.

1414
00:51:58,158 --> 00:52:00,029
Oh.

1415
00:52:00,421 --> 00:52:02,467
Guys.

1416
00:52:07,602 --> 00:52:10,170
Can I talk to you guys?

1417
00:52:10,649 --> 00:52:11,824
Guys?

1418
00:52:11,824 --> 00:52:14,392
Are you dating Alex's dad?

1419
00:52:14,392 --> 00:52:16,045
No, I'm not.

1420
00:52:16,045 --> 00:52:19,527
It's okay if you are--
we like him and all-- but...

1421
00:52:19,527 --> 00:52:21,790
I'd have to tell Mom
you're dating a man.

1422
00:52:21,790 --> 00:52:23,575
Sure.

1423
00:52:23,575 --> 00:52:25,620
Sure. That's understandable.

1424
00:52:25,620 --> 00:52:28,536
But no, we're just friends.

1425
00:52:28,536 --> 00:52:32,888
But, you know, thank you
for being so open-minded.

1426
00:52:34,803 --> 00:52:38,807
I mean, honestly, I'm not sure
if I believe anything you say.

1427
00:52:38,807 --> 00:52:41,810
You lied to us.
You and Mom both lied.

1428
00:52:42,376 --> 00:52:45,162
You know what?
You're right. We did.

1429
00:52:45,162 --> 00:52:47,294
We shouldn't have.

1430
00:52:47,294 --> 00:52:49,731
We didn't want
you guys to worry.

1431
00:52:49,731 --> 00:52:53,213
But we should've been honest
with you guys.

1432
00:52:53,213 --> 00:52:54,693
I'm sorry.

1433
00:52:54,693 --> 00:52:57,870
So what's the truth?
Where is she?

1434
00:52:59,088 --> 00:53:01,526
Okay, well...

1435
00:53:02,353 --> 00:53:07,096
...your mom wasn't feeling
like herself, you know?

1436
00:53:07,096 --> 00:53:11,492
So she started to do some things
to make herself feel better.

1437
00:53:11,492 --> 00:53:15,409
Turns out those things
weren't good for her.

1438
00:53:15,409 --> 00:53:18,586
So, she decided,
'cause she's smart,

1439
00:53:18,586 --> 00:53:21,894
to go away to this place
where there are lots of doctors,

1440
00:53:21,894 --> 00:53:23,678
really good doctors,

1441
00:53:23,678 --> 00:53:26,377
to help her feel better
for real.

1442
00:53:26,377 --> 00:53:29,118
Is that what rehab is?

1443
00:53:29,684 --> 00:53:31,991
Yeah. Yeah, kind of.

1444
00:53:31,991 --> 00:53:33,819
Yeah, it's kind of like
when you're,

1445
00:53:33,819 --> 00:53:36,038
you know, when you get sick,

1446
00:53:36,038 --> 00:53:40,434
you guys go to the doctor,
you know?

1447
00:53:40,434 --> 00:53:42,828
Basically the same thing,
except...

1448
00:53:42,828 --> 00:53:44,525
it's just gonna take
a little longer.

1449
00:53:44,525 --> 00:53:45,918
Is she gonna die?

1450
00:53:45,918 --> 00:53:48,181
No, absolutely not.

1451
00:53:48,181 --> 00:53:49,704
She's gonna be fine.

1452
00:53:49,704 --> 00:53:51,402
She's gonna be better
than before, even.

1453
00:53:51,402 --> 00:53:54,927
Is that why she took
all those pills all the time?

1454
00:53:54,927 --> 00:53:58,104
Because she wasn't
feeling like herself?

1455
00:53:59,279 --> 00:54:02,369
Yeah. I didn't know
you knew that.

1456
00:54:02,804 --> 00:54:06,460
Well, I live with her.
It wasn't really a secret.

1457
00:54:07,113 --> 00:54:10,116
Yeah. I wish I was
as smart as you.

1458
00:54:10,116 --> 00:54:12,553
When is she coming home?

1459
00:54:12,553 --> 00:54:14,294
Well, it's gonna take
a little while, you know?

1460
00:54:14,294 --> 00:54:15,861
She's gonna be there
for a little while,

1461
00:54:15,861 --> 00:54:17,254
but then as soon as
she feels better,

1462
00:54:17,254 --> 00:54:19,952
she's gonna come
right back here to us,

1463
00:54:19,952 --> 00:54:22,084
to you guys.

1464
00:54:23,216 --> 00:54:25,087
Promise.

1465
00:54:25,653 --> 00:54:29,178
I know it's not the same,
but, you know...

1466
00:54:30,005 --> 00:54:32,486
I mean, I'm not going anywhere.

1467
00:54:32,486 --> 00:54:36,185
Okay? I'm right here
for you guys. -Mm.

1468
00:54:36,664 --> 00:54:39,014
- Okay?
- 'Kay. -'Kay.

1469
00:54:39,014 --> 00:54:41,147
Hey.

1470
00:54:43,671 --> 00:54:44,977
Perfect.

1471
00:54:44,977 --> 00:54:48,328
You want to see pictures...

1472
00:54:49,286 --> 00:54:51,636
...of where Mom is?

1473
00:54:52,419 --> 00:54:54,160
I don't think so.

1474
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:55,204
Okay.

1475
00:54:55,204 --> 00:54:56,684
I'd like to.

1476
00:54:56,684 --> 00:55:00,035
Okay, check it out.
Look. Come here.

1477
00:55:05,432 --> 00:55:06,433
Pretty, right?

1478
00:55:06,433 --> 00:55:08,740
Mm-hmm.

1479
00:55:17,314 --> 00:55:19,664
So, third bid for the sign

1480
00:55:19,664 --> 00:55:22,231
was more than the first
and the second.

1481
00:55:22,231 --> 00:55:24,712
Ooh.
We can't do that right now.

1482
00:55:24,712 --> 00:55:27,149
That's just too expensive.

1483
00:55:27,149 --> 00:55:29,326
Maybe we'll get
one of those, uh,

1484
00:55:29,326 --> 00:55:31,415
you know, those flags that...

1485
00:55:31,415 --> 00:55:32,720
Forget that-- it's a dumb idea.

1486
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:34,243
I don't even like those flags.

1487
00:55:34,243 --> 00:55:37,508
How about we just paint
the sign on the window?

1488
00:55:37,508 --> 00:55:39,074
That could look cool, right?

1489
00:55:39,074 --> 00:55:41,338
- Okay, yeah, we can do that.
- All right. Work on that.

1490
00:55:41,338 --> 00:55:42,817
- Okay. Will do.
- Okay. Okay.

1491
00:55:42,817 --> 00:55:45,298
Um, and, uh, these came for you.

1492
00:55:45,298 --> 00:55:49,258
Some letters that you sent
to Journeys rehab, I...

1493
00:55:50,259 --> 00:55:52,479
They've been returned.

1494
00:56:08,713 --> 00:56:10,105
Worth a shot.

1495
00:56:10,105 --> 00:56:11,846
I-I'm sorry, man.

1496
00:56:11,846 --> 00:56:14,196
No, we're all right.
It's all right.

1497
00:56:14,196 --> 00:56:15,763
Uh, what do you want
to talk to me about?

1498
00:56:15,763 --> 00:56:17,156
You said you wanted
to talk about something.

1499
00:56:17,156 --> 00:56:19,158
I did, um, but,

1500
00:56:19,158 --> 00:56:22,030
you know, I don't think
now's a great time--

1501
00:56:22,030 --> 00:56:23,205
No, no, no, it's a perfect time.

1502
00:56:23,205 --> 00:56:24,685
I got stuff to do later.
What do you got?

1503
00:56:24,685 --> 00:56:26,644
Okay, um...

1504
00:56:27,819 --> 00:56:31,605
Andy, you know how much
I love working for you.

1505
00:56:31,605 --> 00:56:34,042
Got another offer.

1506
00:56:34,913 --> 00:56:38,351
Actually, my buddy is opening
a gallery in Portland

1507
00:56:38,351 --> 00:56:39,918
and he wants me to manage it.

1508
00:56:39,918 --> 00:56:41,093
I-I just thought with all the...

1509
00:56:41,093 --> 00:56:43,704
all the changes going on
around here...

1510
00:56:43,704 --> 00:56:46,881
I'm really--
I'm really sorry.

1511
00:56:46,881 --> 00:56:49,841
Are you crazy?
You have to do that.

1512
00:56:49,841 --> 00:56:51,408
This is a great thing
for you, man.

1513
00:56:51,408 --> 00:56:53,453
- Yeah? Cool.
- Yeah.

1514
00:56:53,453 --> 00:56:54,715
I command you to do it.

1515
00:56:54,715 --> 00:56:56,064
You have to do it.
Seriously, man.

1516
00:56:56,064 --> 00:56:57,631
That's a great gig
for you, dude.

1517
00:56:57,631 --> 00:56:58,980
- Thank you.
- Congratulations, really.

1518
00:56:58,980 --> 00:57:01,505
Thank you, thank you.

1519
00:57:02,375 --> 00:57:05,987
Hey, Lola. Wow, you came.

1520
00:57:07,119 --> 00:57:09,338
You know what I was thinking?
I'm gonna send an archivist

1521
00:57:09,338 --> 00:57:13,255
over to your mom's studio
just to catalog everything.

1522
00:57:13,255 --> 00:57:16,955
Give the whole... whole thing
some academic grounding.

1523
00:57:16,955 --> 00:57:18,435
- You know?
- Hmm.

1524
00:57:18,435 --> 00:57:20,132
You know, make it available
to students.

1525
00:57:20,132 --> 00:57:23,265
- I like that.
- Yeah.

1526
00:57:23,744 --> 00:57:26,007
This piece...

1527
00:57:26,007 --> 00:57:27,444
it's really intense.

1528
00:57:27,444 --> 00:57:30,229
- My wife painted that.
- Mm.

1529
00:57:30,229 --> 00:57:32,361
Yeah, we're separated.

1530
00:57:32,710 --> 00:57:34,059
I mean--

1531
00:57:34,059 --> 00:57:36,278
I don't know why that matters.
Doesn't matter.

1532
00:57:36,278 --> 00:57:37,889
- That doesn't matter.
-Hey.

1533
00:57:37,889 --> 00:57:40,979
Hey. Hi. Sorry.
Um, Billie's on the phone.

1534
00:57:40,979 --> 00:57:42,067
I told her
that you're in a meeting,

1535
00:57:42,067 --> 00:57:44,243
but she said
that it's important.

1536
00:57:44,243 --> 00:57:45,592
Hold on a minute.
I-I got to get this.

1537
00:57:45,592 --> 00:57:46,941
- Yeah. Take your time.
- My daughter.

1538
00:57:46,941 --> 00:57:48,813
30 seconds.

1539
00:57:50,162 --> 00:57:52,947
Hey. What's up?

1540
00:57:53,339 --> 00:57:55,515
No, you can't see that.

1541
00:57:55,515 --> 00:57:57,865
Because it's PG-13, that's why.

1542
00:57:57,865 --> 00:57:59,171
Hold on. Sorry.

1543
00:57:59,171 --> 00:58:01,956
Don't even try that.
Put Tali on the phone.

1544
00:58:01,956 --> 00:58:03,044
Yeah.

1545
00:58:03,044 --> 00:58:04,785
I didn't say that.

1546
00:58:04,785 --> 00:58:06,352
I never said that.

1547
00:58:06,352 --> 00:58:07,745
Uh, 6:30.

1548
00:58:07,745 --> 00:58:09,181
I'm in the middle of something.

1549
00:58:09,181 --> 00:58:11,226
Turkey burgers, good idea.
Good call, I like it.

1550
00:58:11,226 --> 00:58:14,621
Yes, yes, yes. Go. Okay. Bye.

1551
00:58:14,621 --> 00:58:16,536
Hey. Sorry.

1552
00:58:16,536 --> 00:58:18,103
Oh, no, it's okay.

1553
00:58:18,103 --> 00:58:20,018
How old is your daughter?

1554
00:58:20,018 --> 00:58:22,934
Uh, twins, actually.

1555
00:58:23,325 --> 00:58:25,763
Uh, they're, uh, nine.

1556
00:58:25,763 --> 00:58:27,547
- Nine?
- Yeah.

1557
00:58:27,547 --> 00:58:28,983
Wow.

1558
00:58:28,983 --> 00:58:31,943
Moving into double digits,
though, real soon. Yeah.

1559
00:58:31,943 --> 00:58:34,511
- That is wonderful.
- Yeah.

1560
00:58:34,511 --> 00:58:36,034
- Great age.
- It is a really good age.

1561
00:58:36,034 --> 00:58:37,731
Yeah.

1562
00:58:38,732 --> 00:58:39,951
- Hi.
-Hey.

1563
00:58:39,951 --> 00:58:42,301
- Is he...?
- He's in a meeting.

1564
00:58:47,349 --> 00:58:49,482
Oh, hey, look who it is.

1565
00:58:49,482 --> 00:58:51,397
- Wow. Becca, can you...?
- Yep.

1566
00:58:51,397 --> 00:58:54,748
-Hi, Cy.
- Hello, sweetheart.

1567
00:58:54,748 --> 00:58:56,097
Aw, look at you.

1568
00:58:56,097 --> 00:58:57,577
You look great.

1569
00:58:57,577 --> 00:59:00,145
- Thank you. You, too.
- Well, thank you.

1570
00:59:00,145 --> 00:59:02,713
Yeah. -How you feeling?
How's it going with the...?

1571
00:59:02,713 --> 00:59:04,279
"With the...?"

1572
00:59:04,279 --> 00:59:05,542
- Good.
- Good!

1573
00:59:05,542 --> 00:59:06,760
Yeah, no, I'm good, I'm good.

1574
00:59:06,760 --> 00:59:09,502
Oh, great.
Great, great, great.

1575
00:59:10,198 --> 00:59:11,460
He looks busy, huh?

1576
00:59:11,460 --> 00:59:12,984
Yeah. Yes.

1577
00:59:12,984 --> 00:59:14,899
Yeah...

1578
00:59:14,899 --> 00:59:16,553
I think he forgot
about our hike.

1579
00:59:16,553 --> 00:59:18,206
- No, I don't think so.
- Yeah.

1580
00:59:18,206 --> 00:59:20,165
I don't think so, no.
Theresa Thompson's daughter

1581
00:59:20,165 --> 00:59:21,558
just popped in unexpectedly,

1582
00:59:21,558 --> 00:59:24,343
which I have to say
is very exciting.

1583
00:59:24,343 --> 00:59:27,564
This estate could be
the answer to our prayers.

1584
00:59:27,564 --> 00:59:29,566
It's been rough lately, so...

1585
00:59:29,566 --> 00:59:31,872
- Very...
- Oh.

1586
00:59:31,872 --> 00:59:34,353
I'm so excited about this hike
the two of you are going on.

1587
00:59:34,353 --> 00:59:36,094
Outdoors, fresh air.

1588
00:59:36,094 --> 00:59:39,401
I know he needs
his head cleared a little bit.

1589
00:59:39,401 --> 00:59:41,534
- Sure.
-So sorry.

1590
00:59:41,534 --> 00:59:43,014
I knew I had something.
Damn it.

1591
00:59:43,014 --> 00:59:45,059
Something.

1592
00:59:45,059 --> 00:59:46,321
Hey.

1593
00:59:46,321 --> 00:59:49,977
Lola Thompson,
this is my very pregnant--

1594
00:59:49,977 --> 00:59:53,590
and I think pretty mad at me--
daughter, Grace.

1595
00:59:53,590 --> 00:59:54,939
Grace, Lola.

1596
00:59:54,939 --> 00:59:56,854
- It's so nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

1597
00:59:56,854 --> 00:59:58,899
Uh, Dad, we can reschedule.
It's fine.

1598
00:59:58,899 --> 01:00:00,466
No. No, no, no.
I'm just gonna do this,

1599
01:00:00,466 --> 01:00:01,902
- and we'll go.
- When are you due?

1600
01:00:01,902 --> 01:00:03,774
Uh, six weeks.

1601
01:00:03,774 --> 01:00:05,732
It is the most magical time.

1602
01:00:05,732 --> 01:00:07,691
I'm actually pretty
uncomfortable.

1603
01:00:07,691 --> 01:00:09,257
Can I?

1604
01:00:09,257 --> 01:00:11,172
Yeah, of course.

1605
01:00:12,347 --> 01:00:14,393
My daughter's 17.

1606
01:00:14,393 --> 01:00:16,395
It all goes by
in the blink of an eye.

1607
01:00:16,395 --> 01:00:19,180
- Doesn't it?
-  Yeah.

1608
01:00:19,180 --> 01:00:20,791
Wait a minute, you--

1609
01:00:20,791 --> 01:00:24,272
I-I'm holding a breath work
at my house tomorrow night.

1610
01:00:24,272 --> 01:00:27,362
What are you guys doing?
Would you like to come?

1611
01:00:27,362 --> 01:00:30,104
Please come.

1612
01:00:31,540 --> 01:00:33,368
- Yeah.
-Yeah?

1613
01:00:33,368 --> 01:00:35,849
Yeah, I can-- I can learn
to breathe better.

1614
01:00:41,986 --> 01:00:43,988
Cy mentioned it
like I should know.

1615
01:00:43,988 --> 01:00:46,817
Dad, what's going on?
You're so secretive.

1616
01:00:46,817 --> 01:00:49,428
Well, things aren't
so hot right now.

1617
01:00:49,428 --> 01:00:51,778
The gallery,
we can't pay our rent, and...

1618
01:00:51,778 --> 01:00:53,737
Our artists aren't selling.
I don't know.

1619
01:00:53,737 --> 01:00:57,305
Hasn't been-- Hasn't been
my best year.

1620
01:00:57,305 --> 01:00:58,872
Are you thinking
you might close?

1621
01:00:58,872 --> 01:01:00,134
- No, no, no, no.
- Oh.

1622
01:01:00,134 --> 01:01:01,701
I'll figure it out.
I'll figure it out.

1623
01:01:01,701 --> 01:01:03,485
Yeah, no, of course.
Of course you will.

1624
01:01:03,485 --> 01:01:04,965
Yeah.

1625
01:01:04,965 --> 01:01:07,228
The Therea estate will be, uh...

1626
01:01:07,228 --> 01:01:08,882
That'll be big if we get that.

1627
01:01:08,882 --> 01:01:10,710
That'll put us back on the map.

1628
01:01:10,710 --> 01:01:13,365
I don't know, it kills me.

1629
01:01:13,365 --> 01:01:15,062
I look around the office

1630
01:01:15,062 --> 01:01:17,978
and, man, I love
these people so much.

1631
01:01:17,978 --> 01:01:20,067
I hate seeing them out there.

1632
01:01:20,067 --> 01:01:23,114
If they have to go
look for a job, that'll kill me.

1633
01:01:23,114 --> 01:01:25,333
I'll tell ya.

1634
01:01:25,333 --> 01:01:27,031
Man, and I had everybody
back in the day.

1635
01:01:27,031 --> 01:01:28,772
I had such a good eye.

1636
01:01:28,772 --> 01:01:30,948
I don't know, maybe I lost it.
Maybe I'm out of touch.

1637
01:01:30,948 --> 01:01:32,906
Hold on.
You didn't lose anything.

1638
01:01:32,906 --> 01:01:35,343
And you're very in touch
for someone, mm...

1639
01:01:35,343 --> 01:01:37,563
- you know, matur-- mature.
- My age.

1640
01:01:37,563 --> 01:01:39,478
- Well, yeah.
- Yeah.

1641
01:01:40,697 --> 01:01:43,134
I get it. I get it.

1642
01:01:43,134 --> 01:01:44,831
Yeah.

1643
01:01:44,831 --> 01:01:48,705
The problem is, I am not even
remotely ready to be done yet.

1644
01:01:48,705 --> 01:01:51,708
I got so much more to give
and I've got great ideas

1645
01:01:51,708 --> 01:01:53,448
and things I want to do.

1646
01:01:53,448 --> 01:01:55,755
You know, I'm probably
in my head too much these days.

1647
01:01:55,755 --> 01:01:57,626
- You know how you do that?
- Yeah.

1648
01:01:57,626 --> 01:01:59,280
You get up there and... I got
a wife who won't talk to me.

1649
01:01:59,280 --> 01:02:01,674
I got a shitty business--
Can we sit for a second?

1650
01:02:03,284 --> 01:02:04,808
Oy.

1651
01:02:04,808 --> 01:02:07,375
This is hard, this hiking thing.

1652
01:02:09,334 --> 01:02:10,639
What? Don't look at--

1653
01:02:10,639 --> 01:02:12,729
Honey. We're not there yet.

1654
01:02:12,729 --> 01:02:14,208
I'm not looking.
There's no look.

1655
01:02:14,208 --> 01:02:15,775
There was a look.

1656
01:02:15,775 --> 01:02:17,168
I'm gonna be fine. Come on.

1657
01:02:17,168 --> 01:02:19,257
Everything's all right.

1658
01:02:19,257 --> 01:02:21,172
- Okay?
- Here.

1659
01:02:21,172 --> 01:02:25,698
If life isn't kicking your ass,
it's not doing its job.

1660
01:02:27,787 --> 01:02:29,963
I am so sorry I laid--
Oh, come on.

1661
01:02:29,963 --> 01:02:32,792
I shouldn't have laid
all of this on you. I'm sorry.

1662
01:02:32,792 --> 01:02:35,229
No, it's fine, honestly.

1663
01:02:35,229 --> 01:02:36,883
Honestly, this happens
all the time.

1664
01:02:36,883 --> 01:02:39,843
I just-- I can't control it.
It's fine. I promise.

1665
01:02:39,843 --> 01:02:43,672
Okay. -I just, I know
how much your work means to you.

1666
01:02:44,543 --> 01:02:47,546
And I don't know what to say.
I-I-I hate this, I...

1667
01:02:47,546 --> 01:02:49,243
I hate seeing you like this.

1668
01:02:49,243 --> 01:02:50,984
I hate being like this.

1669
01:02:50,984 --> 01:02:53,378
- What can I do?
- Nothing. I mean, we're fine.

1670
01:02:53,378 --> 01:02:55,075
Don't worry about it.

1671
01:02:55,075 --> 01:02:58,252
Just don't cry, 'cause if you
cry, then I'm gonna cry and...

1672
01:02:58,252 --> 01:03:00,298
we're up here in nature, crying.

1673
01:03:00,298 --> 01:03:03,692
I've never seen you cry.

1674
01:03:03,692 --> 01:03:06,304
- Really?
- Okay, once.

1675
01:03:06,304 --> 01:03:07,827
One time.

1676
01:03:07,827 --> 01:03:09,133
I hated it.

1677
01:03:09,133 --> 01:03:11,309
- Don't do it.
-  Okay.

1678
01:03:11,309 --> 01:03:13,267
Noted.

1679
01:03:16,444 --> 01:03:17,794
I'm gonna be fine.

1680
01:03:17,794 --> 01:03:19,360
Maybe I should cry.

1681
01:03:19,360 --> 01:03:21,536
Uh, well, if there was
a time to cry,

1682
01:03:21,536 --> 01:03:24,583
- this is-- this is a good time.
- Okay.

1683
01:03:24,583 --> 01:03:26,324
Things ain't that great,
but I won't.

1684
01:03:26,324 --> 01:03:27,673
- Not going to.
- Me, neither.

1685
01:03:27,673 --> 01:03:29,066
- I'm gonna be fine.
- Me, too.

1686
01:03:29,066 --> 01:03:30,937
I promise you. Look at me.

1687
01:03:30,937 --> 01:03:32,809
We're gonna be good, right?

1688
01:03:32,809 --> 01:03:34,898
Don't worry about me.
I'm gonna be fine.

1689
01:03:34,898 --> 01:03:36,116
I'm always fine.

1690
01:03:36,116 --> 01:03:39,511
Come on, let's go.
Let's go climb a...

1691
01:03:39,511 --> 01:03:41,078
hill or something.

1692
01:03:41,078 --> 01:03:43,820
Come on. Oldie and preggers.

1693
01:03:43,820 --> 01:03:45,430
Dad.

1694
01:03:45,430 --> 01:03:47,736
Oh, sorry, sorry.

1695
01:03:47,736 --> 01:03:49,390
GRACE [grunts]:
Okay.

1696
01:03:49,913 --> 01:03:52,654
What year did
the California gold rush begin?

1697
01:03:52,654 --> 01:03:54,961
What year was it?

1698
01:03:55,788 --> 01:03:59,052
Was it... 1848?

1699
01:03:59,052 --> 01:04:00,837
Thank you very much.

1700
01:04:00,837 --> 01:04:02,360
Nice! Nice!

1701
01:04:02,360 --> 01:04:04,449
And where was it
first discovered?

1702
01:04:04,449 --> 01:04:05,276
That's easy.

1703
01:04:05,276 --> 01:04:06,799
-Really?
- Yeah.

1704
01:04:06,799 --> 01:04:08,845
Is it...

1705
01:04:09,323 --> 01:04:10,498
...uh, Sutter's Mill?

1706
01:04:10,498 --> 01:04:12,587
Mose Goodrich,
ladies and gentlemen.

1707
01:04:12,587 --> 01:04:14,546
Thank you very much.
There you go.

1708
01:04:14,546 --> 01:04:18,332
How's everybody feeling
about our dual sleepovers?

1709
01:04:18,332 --> 01:04:20,421
- Excited.
- Very excited. -Me, too.

1710
01:04:20,421 --> 01:04:22,336
But what are you ever
going to do without us?

1711
01:04:22,336 --> 01:04:24,295
Me? Huge party.

1712
01:04:24,295 --> 01:04:26,471
Big, big party here.
Yeah, catered.

1713
01:04:26,471 --> 01:04:27,472
-Really?
- People, celebrities.

1714
01:04:27,472 --> 01:04:29,039
- Dad.
- DJ.

1715
01:04:29,039 --> 01:04:31,519
- What are you really doing?
- No.

1716
01:04:31,519 --> 01:04:32,869
Billie and I have a thing.

1717
01:04:32,869 --> 01:04:33,957
I'm Billie.

1718
01:04:33,957 --> 01:04:35,872
I mean Gracie.
Sorry. Sorry, sorry.

1719
01:04:35,872 --> 01:04:38,048
There, that's you.
That's yours.

1720
01:04:38,048 --> 01:04:39,353
Let's get going.

1721
01:04:39,353 --> 01:04:41,268
That lady at the front desk
freaks me out.

1722
01:04:41,268 --> 01:04:42,966
She kind of scares me, really.

1723
01:04:42,966 --> 01:04:45,533
Did you pack me
a chocolate chip cookie?

1724
01:04:45,533 --> 01:04:47,405
- I did.
- The kind I like?

1725
01:04:47,405 --> 01:04:49,668
Exactly. Crispy on the outside.

1726
01:04:49,668 --> 01:04:51,800
Nice and gooey and soft
in the center.

1727
01:04:51,800 --> 01:04:53,541
- Did I get one, too?
- Yes, you did.

1728
01:04:53,541 --> 01:04:55,152
You got two.

1729
01:04:55,152 --> 01:04:56,936
-Hey! I heard that.
- Hey, come on, come on.

1730
01:04:56,936 --> 01:04:59,504
Come on, come on.

1731
01:05:11,298 --> 01:05:16,347
Deep breathing brings you
to a higher vibration.

1732
01:05:17,739 --> 01:05:20,220
Take it nice and slow.

1733
01:05:20,220 --> 01:05:24,485
Tune in to what's happening
inside your body.

1734
01:05:26,270 --> 01:05:29,926
Feel your stress reducing,
your anxiety melting.

1735
01:05:31,884 --> 01:05:34,191
In the areas around your chest,

1736
01:05:34,191 --> 01:05:36,889
your shoulders.

1737
01:05:37,411 --> 01:05:39,239
Tune in to it.

1738
01:05:41,154 --> 01:05:43,069
Tuned. I'm tuned right there.

1739
01:05:43,069 --> 01:05:45,463
Breathe in through your nose,

1740
01:05:45,463 --> 01:05:47,291
out through your mouth.

1741
01:05:48,814 --> 01:05:51,512
Let your body move organically.

1742
01:05:52,426 --> 01:05:56,474
Now let's bring some movement,
involving your shoulders.

1743
01:05:58,911 --> 01:06:00,739
Your arms.

1744
01:06:05,483 --> 01:06:10,401
Now, chin to chest, and hold.

1745
01:06:11,924 --> 01:06:13,360
Open with breath.

1746
01:06:15,580 --> 01:06:17,799
Yeah. Come on, guys.

1747
01:06:17,799 --> 01:06:20,367
Get out all of
that negative energy.

1748
01:06:20,367 --> 01:06:22,239
Really get it out of you.

1749
01:06:24,067 --> 01:06:26,330
All of that trauma,

1750
01:06:26,330 --> 01:06:29,115
it all lives in your body.
Shake it out.

1751
01:06:29,115 --> 01:06:30,073
I'm shaking.

1752
01:06:30,073 --> 01:06:33,206
And let go.

1753
01:06:34,512 --> 01:06:36,340
Now you let the light in.

1754
01:06:36,340 --> 01:06:38,255
- Through your toes.
- Okay.

1755
01:06:39,996 --> 01:06:41,998
Into your kneecaps,

1756
01:06:41,998 --> 01:06:44,087
your mind,

1757
01:06:44,087 --> 01:06:45,740

1775

I want you to channel a word

1776
01:07:48,325 --> 01:07:50,762
that describes
what you feel you need most

1777
01:07:50,762 --> 01:07:52,677
from the world right now.

1778
01:07:52,677 --> 01:07:56,420
We're all going to shout
our words at the exact same time

1779
01:07:56,420 --> 01:07:59,684
- and release them.
- Help!

1780
01:08:00,641 --> 01:08:03,122
I was... gonna count to three.

1781
01:08:03,122 --> 01:08:04,950
Sorry.

1782
01:08:10,434 --> 01:08:12,697
How you feeling, Goodrich?

1783
01:08:12,697 --> 01:08:14,394
- Fantastic.
- Yeah?

1784
01:08:14,394 --> 01:08:17,702
I didn't-- I didn't know
that I needed this.

1785
01:08:17,702 --> 01:08:20,748
Turns out, man,
I really needed this. -

1786
01:08:20,748 --> 01:08:22,663
Honestly, th-thanks
for inviting us.

1787
01:08:22,663 --> 01:08:25,797
This was really, uh,
this was something.

1788
01:08:25,797 --> 01:08:28,278
- Yeah. That makes me so happy.
- Oh, good.

1789
01:08:28,278 --> 01:08:29,496
Yeah, I wanted to talk to you.

1790
01:08:29,496 --> 01:08:31,455
I-I've been thinking
about this a lot.

1791
01:08:31,455 --> 01:08:32,978
Um...

1792
01:08:32,978 --> 01:08:36,634
I like the idea of being
with a boutique gallery

1793
01:08:36,634 --> 01:08:38,723
that really understands

1794
01:08:38,723 --> 01:08:41,117
and gives us the attention
that we deserve.

1795
01:08:41,117 --> 01:08:44,511
You know? And-and more
than that, more importantly,

1796
01:08:44,511 --> 01:08:46,470
I'm all about family, and...

1797
01:08:46,470 --> 01:08:48,994
watching you tonight
with your daughter, I-I...

1798
01:08:48,994 --> 01:08:52,302
It really spoke to me
the kind of man that you are.

1799
01:08:52,302 --> 01:08:56,001
And, uh, I think
that's the kind of man,

1800
01:08:56,001 --> 01:08:58,873
kind of person,
that I want out in the world

1801
01:08:58,873 --> 01:09:00,614
representing my mom.

1802
01:09:00,614 --> 01:09:04,052
Oh, man. Wow. That's great.

1803
01:09:04,052 --> 01:09:07,665
Thanks. One night in Topanga,
all of a sudden I'm a hugger.

1804
01:09:09,145 --> 01:09:11,712
This-- Oh, wow, I can't
tell you, I am thrilled.

1805
01:09:11,712 --> 01:09:13,061
- Just thrilled.
- Yeah, I am, too.

1806
01:09:13,061 --> 01:09:15,803
I promise you,
we're gonna do great for you.

1807
01:09:15,803 --> 01:09:17,762
I know you will.

1808
01:09:17,762 --> 01:09:19,459
ANDY [exhales]:
I'm breathing right.

1809
01:09:19,459 --> 01:09:20,895
I'm back in business.

1810
01:09:20,895 --> 01:09:22,680
- This-- that was fun.
-Yeah.

1811
01:09:22,680 --> 01:09:24,116
And it's all because
of you, you know that, right?

1812
01:09:24,116 --> 01:09:25,639
Yeah, hardly, but I'll take it.

1813
01:09:25,639 --> 01:09:27,685
No, it was.
It was fun. Thanks, hon.

1814
01:09:27,685 --> 01:09:29,382
Let's go do something.
Let's celebrate. Come on.

1815
01:09:29,382 --> 01:09:31,776
Oy, it's late.
Plus, what about your kids?

1816
01:09:31,776 --> 01:09:34,039
- Don't you have to go home?
- Eh, they're at sleepovers.

1817
01:09:34,039 --> 01:09:35,083
Come on, what do you want to do?

1818
01:09:35,083 --> 01:09:36,563
- You can't drink.
-  No.

1819
01:09:36,563 --> 01:09:39,000
Okay, let's go
get some ice cream.

1820
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:40,176
You love mint chip.

1821
01:09:40,176 --> 01:09:42,003
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1822
01:09:42,003 --> 01:09:44,397
Okay. I know a cute
little place in Venice.

1823
01:09:44,397 --> 01:09:46,225
If we hurry, we can get there
before it closes.

1824
01:09:46,225 --> 01:09:47,748
Let's go.

1825
01:09:49,576 --> 01:09:52,318
Hold on a minute.
Let me just do this.

1826
01:09:52,318 --> 01:09:54,015
Yello. Hello.

1827
01:09:54,015 --> 01:09:55,191
Hey, hi.

1828
01:09:55,191 --> 01:09:58,237
Calm down.
Do you have a temperature?

1829
01:10:01,806 --> 01:10:03,895
Yeah.

1830
01:10:04,548 --> 01:10:06,114
Okay, okay, okay.

1831
01:10:06,114 --> 01:10:07,290
I'll come there.
I'll come there.

1832
01:10:07,290 --> 01:10:09,074
I'll be there in 30 minutes.

1833
01:10:09,466 --> 01:10:11,424
30 minutes is not a long time.

1834
01:10:11,424 --> 01:10:14,427
Do you want to stay
on the phone with me?

1835
01:10:16,777 --> 01:10:20,433
It's gonna be okay.
I love you, too, honey.

1836
01:10:22,130 --> 01:10:23,175
It's Grace.

1837
01:10:23,175 --> 01:10:24,872
I'm Grace.

1838
01:10:24,872 --> 01:10:27,745
It's Billie. Sorry. Billie.

1839
01:10:28,311 --> 01:10:30,617
She's not feeling well. Can...

1840
01:10:30,617 --> 01:10:33,054
Can we have a rain check
on that ice cream cone?

1841
01:10:33,054 --> 01:10:34,534
Yeah.

1842
01:10:34,534 --> 01:10:36,797
Okay.

1843
01:10:37,233 --> 01:10:39,191
Yeah.

1844
01:10:56,817 --> 01:10:58,645
Hey, Ann.

1845
01:10:58,645 --> 01:11:00,517
Andy. Hey.

1846
01:11:00,517 --> 01:11:02,170
- Hey.
- Hi.

1847
01:11:02,170 --> 01:11:04,912
- Hey.
- Geez, I must be early.

1848
01:11:04,912 --> 01:11:06,566
Grace didn't tell me
you were gonna be here.

1849
01:11:06,566 --> 01:11:08,307
Well, me and the kids
baked some cookies,

1850
01:11:08,307 --> 01:11:10,353
and we just dropped them off.

1851
01:11:10,353 --> 01:11:11,354
How are you?

1852
01:11:11,354 --> 01:11:13,617
I'm, uh, you know...

1853
01:11:13,617 --> 01:11:15,445
No, I-I'm sorry.

1854
01:11:15,445 --> 01:11:16,620
Grace told me. I...

1855
01:11:16,620 --> 01:11:18,709
I feel for Naomi.

1856
01:11:18,709 --> 01:11:20,537
Yeah, okay. Thank you.

1857
01:11:20,537 --> 01:11:22,539
Thanks. Yeah.

1858
01:11:22,539 --> 01:11:24,280
Hey, congratulations.

1859
01:11:24,280 --> 01:11:27,065
You're big-time now.
That-that's a great gig.

1860
01:11:27,065 --> 01:11:28,371
- Way to go.
- Yeah.

1861
01:11:28,371 --> 01:11:30,155
- Yeah, thanks. Uh...
- Yeah.

1862
01:11:30,155 --> 01:11:32,026
I'm crazy busy.
I travel nonstop,

1863
01:11:32,026 --> 01:11:33,506
which I don't love
so much anymore,

1864
01:11:33,506 --> 01:11:36,248
but I'll slow down
once the baby comes.

1865
01:11:36,248 --> 01:11:37,205
Yeah, sure, sure.

1866
01:11:37,205 --> 01:11:38,424
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1867
01:11:38,424 --> 01:11:40,296
Anyway, how are you holding up?

1868
01:11:40,296 --> 01:11:41,514
You didn't answer.

1869
01:11:41,514 --> 01:11:45,301
Uh, you know, okay,
uh, surprisingly.

1870
01:11:45,301 --> 01:11:46,563
I'm-I'm okay.

1871
01:11:46,563 --> 01:11:48,782
You're always okay.

1872
01:11:48,782 --> 01:11:50,567
Well...

1873
01:11:50,567 --> 01:11:51,959
That was a compliment.

1874
01:11:51,959 --> 01:11:53,831
Didn't feel like it,
but, you know, it's okay.

1875
01:11:53,831 --> 01:11:57,356
Wait, you got
the Theresa Thompson estate.

1876
01:11:57,356 --> 01:11:58,705
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Oh, wow.

1877
01:11:58,705 --> 01:12:00,664
- That's major. Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, it's good.

1878
01:12:00,664 --> 01:12:02,100
It's good. Yeah, yeah.

1879
01:12:02,100 --> 01:12:04,320
You know, I think
I turned you on to her.

1880
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:07,540
Oh, I don't think so.

1881
01:12:08,236 --> 01:12:11,196
Why aren't you at the gallery?
It's almost 11:00.

1882
01:12:11,196 --> 01:12:12,415
This has got to be a first.

1883
01:12:12,415 --> 01:12:14,025
I don't know, you know,
go to the market,

1884
01:12:14,025 --> 01:12:16,375
uh, drop the kids off
at school, come here.

1885
01:12:16,375 --> 01:12:18,116
You at the market?

1886
01:12:18,116 --> 01:12:21,467
Me at the market.
I'm a market guy now.

1887
01:12:21,946 --> 01:12:23,382
Hey, if you're early,

1888
01:12:23,382 --> 01:12:24,905
you want to go get
a cup of coffee or something?

1889
01:12:24,905 --> 01:12:26,167
Take a walk?

1890
01:12:26,167 --> 01:12:28,213
Come on, just say yes
before, you know,

1891
01:12:28,213 --> 01:12:29,562
before you think of an excuse.

1892
01:12:40,138 --> 01:12:42,706
Oh, wow. Yeah.

1893
01:12:43,271 --> 01:12:45,448
- Oh, wow. Just so stunning.
-She still has it.

1894
01:12:45,448 --> 01:12:47,363
Have you thought about, um...

1895
01:12:56,415 --> 01:12:58,635
Hey, let me ask you a question.

1896
01:12:58,635 --> 01:13:00,071
What do you think about Pete?

1897
01:13:00,071 --> 01:13:02,943
- Oh, Pete's great.
- Really?

1898
01:13:02,943 --> 01:13:04,728
- Yeah.
- No, I-I like Pete.

1899
01:13:04,728 --> 01:13:09,689
It's just that she's so funny
and Pete is, like, so not.

1900
01:13:09,689 --> 01:13:12,126
Uh, he's nice, you know.

1901
01:13:12,126 --> 01:13:13,954
Yeah, but yeah, who cares?

1902
01:13:13,954 --> 01:13:16,957
- He's gonna be a great dad.
- Yeah, you're probably right.

1903
01:13:16,957 --> 01:13:19,003
She's the great one.
Oh, my God, she's fantastic.

1904
01:13:19,003 --> 01:13:20,874
You say that
like you just met her.

1905
01:13:20,874 --> 01:13:23,355
No, I mean, we've been spending
a lot of time together.

1906
01:13:23,355 --> 01:13:24,400
That's...

1907
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:25,923
You did a great job, Ann.
Really.

1908
01:13:25,923 --> 01:13:28,534
You were always willing to,
you know,

1909
01:13:28,534 --> 01:13:30,580
give anything up for the family.

1910
01:13:30,580 --> 01:13:33,452
Thanks. I admire that. Really.

1911
01:13:34,018 --> 01:13:36,629
You see, that's the difference
between me and you.

1912
01:13:36,629 --> 01:13:39,415
I never saw it as
giving anything up.

1913
01:13:41,460 --> 01:13:43,680
Ann. There you are.

1914
01:13:43,680 --> 01:13:44,811
Oh.

1915
01:13:44,811 --> 01:13:48,641
Um, Andy, this is Barry Klein.

1916
01:13:48,641 --> 01:13:49,903
Nice to finally meet you.

1917
01:13:49,903 --> 01:13:52,297
- Nice to meet you.
-Oh, that's right.

1918
01:13:52,297 --> 01:13:55,343
We're taking Grace out to lunch,
if you want to join us.

1919
01:13:55,343 --> 01:13:57,345
You know, I would,
but I got to go to the gallery,

1920
01:13:57,345 --> 01:13:59,652
and then I got a--
I got a thing I got to do.

1921
01:13:59,652 --> 01:14:00,914
But I'm gonna see you

1922
01:14:00,914 --> 01:14:02,786
at Christmas anyway
at Gracie's, right?

1923
01:14:02,786 --> 01:14:05,353
Actually, um, we're going
to New York for the holidays.

1924
01:14:05,353 --> 01:14:07,530
You know, quick trip
before the baby comes.

1925
01:14:07,530 --> 01:14:09,270
Can't beat Christmas
in the city, eh?

1926
01:14:09,270 --> 01:14:10,576
No, you can't.

1927
01:14:10,576 --> 01:14:12,448
It's gonna be beautiful.
It's gonna be great.

1928
01:14:12,448 --> 01:14:14,232
Thanks. Shall we?

1929
01:14:14,232 --> 01:14:15,407
Uh, yeah.

1930
01:14:15,407 --> 01:14:17,801
Take care, Andy.

1931
01:14:53,967 --> 01:14:56,100
Hey, that's pretty good, guys.

1932
01:14:56,100 --> 01:14:58,711
Lola Thompson's here.

1933
01:14:59,451 --> 01:15:01,671
Oh, already?

1934
01:15:01,671 --> 01:15:03,716
Okay.

1935
01:15:06,937 --> 01:15:09,287
Definitely not Swiss Mocha,
I can tell you that.

1936
01:15:09,287 --> 01:15:10,593
Okay.

1937
01:15:10,593 --> 01:15:12,333
Whites will make you crazy.
Simply White.

1938
01:15:12,333 --> 01:15:14,074
- Simply White. Okay.
- That's the color.

1939
01:15:14,074 --> 01:15:15,336
- Hey, hi.
- Hey.

1940
01:15:15,336 --> 01:15:17,121
You're early.
That's okay, that's okay.

1941
01:15:17,121 --> 01:15:18,775
That's a good thing.
That's a good thing.

1942
01:15:18,775 --> 01:15:20,254
PR team's not here yet,

1943
01:15:20,254 --> 01:15:22,518
and I have got a ton of stuff
to go over with you.

1944
01:15:22,518 --> 01:15:24,215
First, come meet my kids.

1945
01:15:24,215 --> 01:15:25,695
Yeah, Andy, wait. Wait.

1946
01:15:25,695 --> 01:15:29,046
Um, I came early
'cause I need to talk to you.

1947
01:15:29,046 --> 01:15:31,091
Okay.

1948
01:15:31,701 --> 01:15:34,617
Yeah, there's really
no easy way to say this.

1949
01:15:34,617 --> 01:15:38,011
Um, it's not personal, okay?

1950
01:15:38,011 --> 01:15:41,058
-  Okay.
- I want you to know that.

1951
01:15:41,537 --> 01:15:43,060
Oh, I should just
say it, I guess.

1952
01:15:43,060 --> 01:15:47,760
Um, I gave the estate
to another gallery.

1953
01:15:48,369 --> 01:15:50,110
One in New York.

1954
01:15:50,110 --> 01:15:51,808
They flew out here,
and they, uh,

1955
01:15:51,808 --> 01:15:55,463
they-they lined me up
with a huge buyer already,

1956
01:15:55,463 --> 01:15:58,249
promised me a-a show
in every city.

1957
01:15:58,249 --> 01:15:59,946
New York, London, Paris.

1958
01:15:59,946 --> 01:16:02,819
We... we even got accepted
to Basel.

1959
01:16:02,819 --> 01:16:05,082
Yeah. Wait a minute.

1960
01:16:05,604 --> 01:16:07,563
Is this a done deal?

1961
01:16:08,694 --> 01:16:09,869
Yeah, it is.

1962
01:16:09,869 --> 01:16:13,438
I just signed
the contracts, and...

1963
01:16:13,438 --> 01:16:17,224
you know,
we didn't have any, so...

1964
01:16:17,616 --> 01:16:19,357
No, we didn't.

1965
01:16:19,357 --> 01:16:21,533
We didn't have a contract
'cause all we had was,

1966
01:16:21,533 --> 01:16:23,274
you know, your word.

1967
01:16:23,274 --> 01:16:26,886
Andy.

1968
01:16:30,020 --> 01:16:31,238
Let me ask you something.

1969
01:16:31,238 --> 01:16:32,675
The whole thing about, you know,

1970
01:16:32,675 --> 01:16:35,155
family and everything,
what was that? Was that--

1971
01:16:35,155 --> 01:16:37,027
That was true, of course.

1972
01:16:37,027 --> 01:16:39,464
This wasn't an easy move for me.

1973
01:16:39,464 --> 01:16:40,944
I-I wasn't looking for this.

1974
01:16:40,944 --> 01:16:42,510
They pursued me.

1975
01:16:42,510 --> 01:16:44,948
The offer was just...

1976
01:16:45,862 --> 01:16:48,299
It's a lot of money, Andy.

1977
01:16:48,299 --> 01:16:50,867
I'm a 50-year-old single mom.

1978
01:16:50,867 --> 01:16:52,651
- I know, I know--
-Dad, help!

1979
01:16:52,651 --> 01:16:54,653
It's Alex!

1980
01:17:07,100 --> 01:17:08,232
Excuse me.

1981
01:17:08,232 --> 01:17:10,190
Hi. I'm looking for
Alexander Koch.

1982
01:17:10,190 --> 01:17:12,149
He was brought in about
an hour ago. I'm his father.

1983
01:17:12,149 --> 01:17:14,238
Okay, uh, room 702,
down the hall, to the right.

1984
01:17:14,238 --> 01:17:15,456
Okay, thank you.

1985
01:17:32,386 --> 01:17:33,736
Hey.

1986
01:17:33,736 --> 01:17:35,781
I was shooting
all the way in Burbank.

1987
01:17:35,781 --> 01:17:38,566
Here's the deal.
The seizure, mild.

1988
01:17:38,566 --> 01:17:40,917
- It was the fall, okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

1989
01:17:40,917 --> 01:17:42,440
Okay, okay, here's the plan.

1990
01:17:42,440 --> 01:17:44,616
They're gonna
keep him overnight,

1991
01:17:44,616 --> 01:17:46,705
just to make sure he doesn't
have another episode, right?

1992
01:17:46,705 --> 01:17:48,359
- Yeah.
- And as soon as he's okay,

1993
01:17:48,359 --> 01:17:49,752
they're just gonna send him
home in the morning,

1994
01:17:49,752 --> 01:17:50,883
and everything will be okay.

1995
01:17:50,883 --> 01:17:52,058
He was so great, man.

1996
01:17:52,058 --> 01:17:54,495
He was so brave
getting his stitches.

1997
01:17:54,495 --> 01:17:56,933
He must have been so scared.
I can't believe I wasn't there.

1998
01:17:56,933 --> 01:17:58,848
Oh, come on,
don't beat yourself up.

1999
01:17:58,848 --> 01:18:01,938
He's gonna be fine.
Honestly, don't worry about it.

2000
01:18:01,938 --> 01:18:03,591
I'm sorry I took my eye off him.

2001
01:18:03,591 --> 01:18:05,768
No. God, come on.

2002
01:18:05,768 --> 01:18:07,030
Hey, you got a gig, huh?

2003
01:18:07,030 --> 01:18:09,119
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
A guest spot on a soap.

2004
01:18:09,119 --> 01:18:10,381
- That's good.
- Yeah.

2005
01:18:10,381 --> 01:18:12,688
- How'd it go?
- Eh, all right.

2006
01:18:12,688 --> 01:18:14,515
- All right, good.
- I finished it.

2007
01:18:14,515 --> 01:18:16,213
You want some tea
or something? Coffee?

2008
01:18:16,213 --> 01:18:17,693
- No. No, no, no, no.
- You sure?

2009
01:18:17,693 --> 01:18:19,085
No, you should go.
It's late. You should--

2010
01:18:19,085 --> 01:18:20,260
No, no, no,
I'll stay here with you.

2011
01:18:20,260 --> 01:18:21,697
- No, no. Thank you. I'm fine.
- Okay.

2012
01:18:21,697 --> 01:18:23,046
Okay, okay.

2013
01:18:23,046 --> 01:18:24,438
All right.

2014
01:18:24,438 --> 01:18:28,094
Hey, don't worry,
he's gonna be fine.

2015
01:18:28,094 --> 01:18:29,226
Don't worry.

2016
01:18:29,226 --> 01:18:31,315
You look worried. Come here.

2017
01:18:31,315 --> 01:18:34,013
- There.
- Thank you.

2018
01:18:36,668 --> 01:18:37,713
All right. Take it easy, buddy.

2019
01:18:37,713 --> 01:18:40,759
Oh, yeah, nope.
All right, sorry.

2020
01:21:33,453 --> 01:21:34,672
- Hey.
- How you doing, man?

2021
01:21:34,672 --> 01:21:35,978
Thanks for coming.

2022
01:21:35,978 --> 01:21:38,023
- Wouldn't miss this.
- Thank you very much.

2023
01:21:38,023 --> 01:21:39,590
- Onward.
- Thanks, buddy.

2024
01:21:39,590 --> 01:21:41,070
- Hey, Doc.
- Hey, love you, man.

2025
01:21:41,070 --> 01:21:42,854
Thanks, man.

2026
01:21:42,854 --> 01:21:44,769
- Ed, you came.
- I can't believe it.

2027
01:21:44,769 --> 01:21:47,728
I just can't believe
Goodrich is closing.

2028
01:21:49,469 --> 01:21:50,775
Hey.

2029
01:21:50,775 --> 01:21:52,429
Well, here we are.

2030
01:21:52,429 --> 01:21:55,258
- Yeah, here we are.
- How you feeling, boss?

2031
01:21:55,258 --> 01:21:57,521
Like I'm having
an out-of-body experience.

2032
01:21:57,521 --> 01:22:00,089
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

2033
01:22:00,567 --> 01:22:02,004
Who invited the accountant?

2034
01:22:02,004 --> 01:22:04,571
Jesus, look at him.

2035
01:22:04,571 --> 01:22:06,660
Yeah, hi.

2036
01:22:06,660 --> 01:22:08,706
Hey.

2037
01:22:08,706 --> 01:22:11,622
I'm gonna go up
and say a few words.

2038
01:22:11,622 --> 01:22:14,190
Yeah, okay. Listen.

2039
01:22:14,190 --> 01:22:15,931
I love you, pal.

2040
01:22:15,931 --> 01:22:19,021
Love you, too, buddy.

2041
01:22:19,021 --> 01:22:20,936
Hey.

2042
01:22:20,936 --> 01:22:23,895
I couldn't have done this
without you, you know.

2043
01:22:24,678 --> 01:22:26,376
I want you to know that.

2044
01:22:31,294 --> 01:22:32,773
Hi. Hey.

2045
01:22:32,773 --> 01:22:34,819
First off...

2046
01:22:34,819 --> 01:22:38,954
I just want to thank everyone
for even coming tonight.

2047
01:22:38,954 --> 01:22:42,653
This is, uh,
this is a special night.

2048
01:22:43,088 --> 01:22:46,526
A sad one, but, you know,
monumental for me.

2049
01:22:46,526 --> 01:22:48,746
This is big.

2050
01:22:48,746 --> 01:22:53,403
You know,
the Buddhists say, in the end,

2051
01:22:53,403 --> 01:22:56,449
there are really only
three things that matter:

2052
01:22:56,449 --> 01:22:58,016
how much you've loved,

2053
01:22:58,016 --> 01:23:00,366
how gently you've lived

2054
01:23:00,366 --> 01:23:03,195
and how gracefully

2055
01:23:03,195 --> 01:23:05,458
you let go of the things

2056
01:23:05,458 --> 01:23:09,245
that really weren't
even meant for you.

2057
01:23:10,594 --> 01:23:12,335
I haven't lived that gently.

2058
01:23:14,685 --> 01:23:17,775
And, uh, I think you all know

2059
01:23:17,775 --> 01:23:20,821
I have a little hard time
letting go of things.

2060
01:23:22,867 --> 01:23:26,479
But then there's love.

2061
01:23:26,479 --> 01:23:29,395
Yeah. Man.

2062
01:23:29,395 --> 01:23:31,267
And the love, I mean,

2063
01:23:31,267 --> 01:23:34,357
I feel so much love
here tonight.

2064
01:23:35,097 --> 01:23:38,143
And I have to tell you,
I have loved this gallery,

2065
01:23:38,143 --> 01:23:41,668
boy, with everything I've got.

2066
01:23:48,936 --> 01:23:51,026
You know, when you see
something with your eyes,

2067
01:23:51,026 --> 01:23:53,158
like, you know,
schoolchildren, let's say,

2068
01:23:53,158 --> 01:23:54,551
crossing the street

2069
01:23:54,551 --> 01:23:57,945
in maybe a little bit
of falling rain

2070
01:23:57,945 --> 01:24:00,122
or the way that morning sun,

2071
01:24:00,122 --> 01:24:01,949
you know, comes
right through your window

2072
01:24:01,949 --> 01:24:05,170
and hits a bowl of fruit
on your kitchen counter...

2073
01:24:05,562 --> 01:24:10,175
Or, even better...

2074
01:24:21,360 --> 01:24:23,449
...that smile
on your daughter's face.

2075
01:24:29,064 --> 01:24:30,935
You know, you...

2076
01:24:30,935 --> 01:24:34,243
you close your eyes
and you think,

2077
01:24:34,243 --> 01:24:36,941
"I have to remember this."

2078
01:24:40,162 --> 01:24:43,817
Because, in that moment,

2079
01:24:43,817 --> 01:24:46,429
that's a piece of art.

2080
01:24:46,907 --> 01:24:49,040
That's just art.

2081
01:24:50,824 --> 01:24:52,913
Oh, boy. Okay.

2082
01:24:52,913 --> 01:24:55,960
Well, this has been
a long journey, folks.

2083
01:24:55,960 --> 01:24:58,180
But it's been
the ride of my life.

2084
01:24:58,180 --> 01:25:00,138
Hey, thanks for coming.

2085
01:25:22,856 --> 01:25:24,902
They all come at the end.

2086
01:25:24,902 --> 01:25:26,208
Dad.

2087
01:25:26,208 --> 01:25:27,774
Eh, it's true.

2088
01:25:27,774 --> 01:25:29,950
Hey, it was so nice
to see everybody.

2089
01:25:29,950 --> 01:25:31,691
Honestly, it was great, but,

2090
01:25:31,691 --> 01:25:35,478
really, did kind of feel like
a guest at my own funeral,

2091
01:25:35,478 --> 01:25:36,522
you know?

2092
01:25:36,522 --> 01:25:38,872
Well, if you ask me,

2093
01:25:38,872 --> 01:25:41,266
I think this is actually
a really good thing.

2094
01:25:41,266 --> 01:25:43,703
- Yeah?
- Yeah, like a whole new chapter.

2095
01:25:43,703 --> 01:25:45,096
Yeah, maybe.

2096
01:25:45,096 --> 01:25:47,707
Hey, I'm gonna get
to see the kids a lot more,

2097
01:25:47,707 --> 01:25:49,927
travel a little bit.

2098
01:25:50,449 --> 01:25:53,583
Maybe even take
some tango lessons.

2099
01:25:54,192 --> 01:25:56,934
And you're gonna be
a grandfather.

2100
01:25:58,414 --> 01:26:02,026
Oh, come on, Goodrich,
it's just a word.

2101
01:26:02,679 --> 01:26:05,160
Okay, I got to--
I got to sit down.

2102
01:26:06,204 --> 01:26:08,641
No, no,
don't worry about it, Dad.

2103
01:26:08,641 --> 01:26:09,686
I got it.

2104
01:26:09,686 --> 01:26:11,557
- Honey...
- No need to help me.

2105
01:26:11,557 --> 01:26:14,865
Honey, you don't have to nail me
at every given opportunity.

2106
01:26:14,865 --> 01:26:17,259
Nicely done, thank you.

2107
01:26:17,259 --> 01:26:19,391
Oh.

2108
01:26:19,391 --> 01:26:21,132
- Grandfather.
- Yeah.

2109
01:26:21,132 --> 01:26:23,221
Grandfather's like a guy
with bushy eyebrows

2110
01:26:23,221 --> 01:26:26,485
and a walking stick
and a tweed jacket.

2111
01:26:26,485 --> 01:26:29,140
I feel like you're describing
the old man from Up.

2112
01:26:31,664 --> 01:26:34,232
Look, I know this conversation
is gonna be held against me

2113
01:26:34,232 --> 01:26:36,539
at some point,
so can we just kind of,

2114
01:26:36,539 --> 01:26:39,281
you know, delete it
from the transcript

2115
01:26:39,281 --> 01:26:42,501
and let it be known
that I am really, really

2116
01:26:42,501 --> 01:26:44,547
excited about the baby.

2117
01:26:44,547 --> 01:26:49,160
In fact, the word "ecstatic"
comes to mind.

2118
01:26:50,422 --> 01:26:52,424
Here.

2119
01:26:53,425 --> 01:26:56,211
I don't know if you've noticed,
but I am extremely pregnant.

2120
01:26:56,211 --> 01:26:57,734
Ah, you're fine.

2121
01:26:57,734 --> 01:26:59,388
You're-you're fully baked.

2122
01:26:59,388 --> 01:27:00,998
You're good. Trust me,

2123
01:27:00,998 --> 01:27:02,347
I've been through
enough pregnancies.

2124
01:27:02,347 --> 01:27:04,828
I know.

2125
01:27:05,220 --> 01:27:07,222
Drink with me.

2126
01:27:11,182 --> 01:27:14,098
Speaking of being
an expert in this field,

2127
01:27:14,098 --> 01:27:17,232
um, I have
my last doctor's appointment

2128
01:27:17,232 --> 01:27:18,842
before Christmas tomorrow,

2129
01:27:18,842 --> 01:27:21,540
and it's getting
a little uncomfortable to drive.

2130
01:27:21,540 --> 01:27:23,977
Mom's in New York
and Pete has to work, so...

2131
01:27:23,977 --> 01:27:26,806
- Now...
- I was wondering if you...

2132
01:27:26,806 --> 01:27:31,550
Your old man is
very, very, very available.

2133
01:27:31,550 --> 01:27:33,683
He would take you.

2134
01:27:33,683 --> 01:27:35,685
Gladly.

2135
01:27:35,685 --> 01:27:38,340
Kidding me? Can't wait.

2136
01:27:40,646 --> 01:27:42,822
Thanks for
coming tonight, honey.

2137
01:27:43,954 --> 01:27:45,172
I know, but still,

2138
01:27:45,172 --> 01:27:47,262
- it was nice.
- Come on.

2139
01:27:51,135 --> 01:27:53,529
You know,
this kind of feels like

2140
01:27:53,529 --> 01:27:56,227
an end of an era for me, too.

2141
01:27:57,837 --> 01:28:00,100
Hmm.

2142
01:28:00,492 --> 01:28:03,060
Well, this midlife crisis

2143
01:28:03,060 --> 01:28:05,628
is no walk in the park,
I'll tell you that.

2144
01:28:05,628 --> 01:28:08,761
I didn't realize you were
planning to live till 120.

2145
01:28:08,761 --> 01:28:10,850
Please don't, okay?

2146
01:28:10,850 --> 01:28:13,157
I don't think I can afford
the therapy bills.

2147
01:28:13,157 --> 01:28:16,378
Ooh, that was nice. 120.

2148
01:28:16,378 --> 01:28:18,423
Oh, my God.

2149
01:28:21,165 --> 01:28:22,384
Hallelujah.

You're home.

2158
01:29:00,160 --> 01:29:02,075
Yeah, I'm-- I'm done.

2159
01:29:02,075 --> 01:29:05,122
I'm out, so...

2160
01:29:05,122 --> 01:29:08,995
God, it's so quiet in here.
Where are the kids?

2161
01:29:08,995 --> 01:29:12,695
They're at their friend's,
some... Alex's house.

2162
01:29:12,695 --> 01:29:13,870
Oh.

2163
01:29:13,870 --> 01:29:17,134
Yeah, I-I know his dad
a little bit.

2164
01:29:17,134 --> 01:29:18,962
I can't wait to see them.

2165
01:29:20,964 --> 01:29:23,923
Look, I'm so sorry.
I-I should've called.

2166
01:29:23,923 --> 01:29:26,186
I just, um...

2167
01:29:26,839 --> 01:29:28,275
I didn't...

2168
01:29:28,275 --> 01:29:30,713
I didn't really know
if you would want to see me.

2169
01:29:30,713 --> 01:29:32,715
No, I mean, I knew
the 90 days were up

2170
01:29:32,715 --> 01:29:35,631
'cause I got this
little reminder on my phone...

2171
01:29:36,719 --> 01:29:39,765
...that went off, so...

2172
01:29:39,765 --> 01:29:41,245
of course I want to see you.

2173
01:29:41,245 --> 01:29:42,377
Andy--

2174
01:29:42,377 --> 01:29:44,422
Why did you have to do it
like that?

2175
01:29:44,422 --> 01:29:46,206
I would've helped you.

2176
01:29:46,206 --> 01:29:48,948
I didn't know what else to do.

2177
01:29:48,948 --> 01:29:52,735
You know, I was scared.
I was so scared.

2178
01:29:52,735 --> 01:29:54,606
And I didn't abandon our family.

2179
01:29:54,606 --> 01:29:56,173
I-I really hope
that you know that.

2180
01:29:56,173 --> 01:29:57,479
I know. I know.

2181
01:29:57,479 --> 01:29:59,176
I just did not want them
to see me like that.

2182
01:29:59,176 --> 01:30:01,047
I know. -It's not how
I want them to think of me.

2183
01:30:01,047 --> 01:30:02,440
I know. I know.

2184
01:30:02,440 --> 01:30:05,400
- I know that.
- Okay.

2185
01:30:06,052 --> 01:30:07,576
I'm sorry, Naomi.

2186
01:30:08,185 --> 01:30:11,231
It's, like, the simplest thing
to say, but...

2187
01:30:11,231 --> 01:30:13,146
this is the...

2188
01:30:13,146 --> 01:30:15,584
first time I've had
a chance to say it

2189
01:30:15,584 --> 01:30:17,629
while actually looking at you.

2190
01:30:17,629 --> 01:30:20,066
Thank you.

2191
01:30:20,502 --> 01:30:22,721
Anyway, um,
I'm on the other side now.

2192
01:30:22,721 --> 01:30:26,421
And-and I'm--
And I'm doing good.

2193
01:30:26,421 --> 01:30:29,206
You know, recovery,
it's just such a journey,

2194
01:30:29,206 --> 01:30:31,426
but I'm-I'm starting to feel
more like myself.

2195
01:30:31,426 --> 01:30:33,428
Great. Good, good, good.

2196
01:30:33,428 --> 01:30:35,430
Hey, I really want to help you
this time, okay?

2197
01:30:35,430 --> 01:30:39,346
'Cause I've been doing a lot
of reading about it and, uh...

2198
01:30:39,346 --> 01:30:42,437
I just really want
to help you, okay?

2199
01:30:42,437 --> 01:30:44,961
I love you.

2200
01:30:49,835 --> 01:30:52,055
I've been--

2201
01:30:52,055 --> 01:30:54,884
I've been doing, um,
a lot of thinking.

2202
01:30:54,884 --> 01:30:59,845
I've had a lot of time to think,
and we are gonna...

2203
01:30:59,845 --> 01:31:01,934
be better as friends.

2204
01:31:05,677 --> 01:31:08,506
Oh. Okay.

2205
01:31:11,509 --> 01:31:15,078
Deep down, didn't you
kind of always know that...

2206
01:31:15,078 --> 01:31:16,340
we weren't gonna make it?

2207
01:31:16,340 --> 01:31:18,168
Uh...

2208
01:31:18,647 --> 01:31:21,258
Actually, I can't say
that I did, no.

2209
01:31:22,433 --> 01:31:25,436
Didn't see that one.

2210
01:31:27,220 --> 01:31:29,484
We've got a lot to be
grateful for. -Yeah.

2211
01:31:29,484 --> 01:31:31,660
You know, we got
two beautiful kids and...

2212
01:31:31,660 --> 01:31:33,618
you're gonna be a grandfather.

2213
01:31:33,618 --> 01:31:35,011
Yep.

2214
01:31:35,011 --> 01:31:37,143
Yeah, about...

2215
01:31:37,143 --> 01:31:38,275
Oh, shit.

2216
01:31:45,500 --> 01:31:48,154
Come on, come on, come on.

2217
01:31:48,154 --> 01:31:49,460
GRACE [recorded]:
Hi. You've reached Grace--

2218
01:31:49,460 --> 01:31:51,636
Ah, geez.

2219
01:31:51,636 --> 01:31:52,942
If you leave a message,
I'll call you back.

2220
01:31:52,942 --> 01:31:54,117
Shit.

2221
01:31:54,117 --> 01:31:56,511
Hi. You've reached Grace.

2222
01:31:56,946 --> 01:31:58,513
Gracie, honey, I'm on my way.

2223
01:31:58,513 --> 01:31:59,992
Okay? Okay, okay.

2224
01:31:59,992 --> 01:32:01,559
Ah, fuck.

2225
01:32:01,559 --> 01:32:03,126
GRACE [recorded]:
Hi. You've reached Grace.

2226
01:32:03,126 --> 01:32:05,084
If you leave a message,
I'll call you back.

2227
01:32:05,084 --> 01:32:08,174
Honey, I'm on my way, okay?
I'll be there in a few minutes.

2228
01:32:16,008 --> 01:32:17,619
Right there is fine. Thank you.

2229
01:32:19,272 --> 01:32:21,623
- Oh, my God.
- I'm here.

2230
01:32:21,623 --> 01:32:23,973
You remembered
you were supposed to pick me up?

2231
01:32:23,973 --> 01:32:25,409
No, I know, honey.
I called Pete,

2232
01:32:25,409 --> 01:32:26,802
and he said to meet you here.

2233
01:32:26,802 --> 01:32:29,108
I tried to reach you.

2234
01:32:29,108 --> 01:32:31,284
What happened, huh?
Something come up with the kids?

2235
01:32:31,284 --> 01:32:33,504
Did you forget?
What was it, Dad?

2236
01:32:33,504 --> 01:32:36,942
Uh, well, uh, Naomi showed up.

2237
01:32:36,942 --> 01:32:39,597
Oh. Okay, well, I'm glad
that she's up and running.

2238
01:32:39,597 --> 01:32:40,772
Maybe now I can just go back

2239
01:32:40,772 --> 01:32:42,687
to being someone
you call from the car.

2240
01:32:42,687 --> 01:32:45,037
Or when you need to know what
temperature to bake a potato.

2241
01:32:45,037 --> 01:32:47,344
- Oh, Gracie, come on.
- Are we done here?

2242
01:32:47,344 --> 01:32:49,564
Because I'm late for a doctor's
appointment because of you.

2243
01:32:49,564 --> 01:32:51,653
I'm sorry. Look, the woman
just showed up at my house.

2244
01:32:51,653 --> 01:32:52,784
What was I supposed to do?

2245
01:32:52,784 --> 01:32:54,569
I haven't talked to her
in 90 days.

2246
01:32:54,569 --> 01:32:55,831
- I have to talk to her.
- No, I get it, I get it.

2247
01:32:55,831 --> 01:32:57,833
- Priorities. I get it.
- No, honey, come on.

2248
01:32:57,833 --> 01:32:59,791
Look, I'm only
a few minutes late. -

2249
01:32:59,791 --> 01:33:01,706
I'm here now.
Let's just go upstairs.

2250
01:33:01,706 --> 01:33:04,448
- You don't get it, do you?
- Get what?

2251
01:33:04,448 --> 01:33:06,189
I waited for you like an idiot.

2252
01:33:06,189 --> 01:33:07,930
I'm so sorry. I feel awful.

2253
01:33:07,930 --> 01:33:09,322
I hate letting you down.

2254
01:33:09,322 --> 01:33:10,976
You hate letting me down?

2255
01:33:10,976 --> 01:33:12,064
Yes, I do.

2256
01:33:12,064 --> 01:33:13,936
You've let me down
my whole life.

2257
01:33:13,936 --> 01:33:16,286
This-- This is nothing.
This is a doctor's appointment.

2258
01:33:16,286 --> 01:33:18,636
How have I let you...?

2259
01:33:19,115 --> 01:33:21,291
Don't answer that.
Let's go upstairs.

2260
01:33:21,291 --> 01:33:22,814
I thought you changed.

2261
01:33:22,814 --> 01:33:24,599
I really did.
I thought you'd grown up.

2262
01:33:24,599 --> 01:33:26,731
And-and you know what?
Maybe you have.

2263
01:33:26,731 --> 01:33:29,299
But it's all for them.
I'm not a part of that.

2264
01:33:29,299 --> 01:33:30,648
I'm a part of the original cast.

2265
01:33:30,648 --> 01:33:31,823
I don't get to reap the benefits

2266
01:33:31,823 --> 01:33:34,260
of the new and improved
Andy Goodrich

2267
01:33:34,260 --> 01:33:37,263
who makes you pancakes
and shows you old movies.

2268
01:33:37,263 --> 01:33:40,266
No, no, I got
the never available, never home,

2269
01:33:40,266 --> 01:33:42,181
never asked you
how your day was Goodrich.

2270
01:33:42,181 --> 01:33:43,879
Honey, this is really
not good for you right now.

2271
01:33:43,879 --> 01:33:45,750
Oh, really?
'Cause I think it is.

2272
01:33:45,750 --> 01:33:47,839
I-I think it's really good
to get things off your chest

2273
01:33:47,839 --> 01:33:50,799
that you've held in
for 30 years.

2274
01:33:50,799 --> 01:33:52,801
I'm mad at you.

2275
01:33:52,801 --> 01:33:56,761
And I have been
for as long as I can remember.

2276
01:33:56,761 --> 01:33:59,111
Just a-a steady stream of mad

2277
01:33:59,111 --> 01:34:01,810
with spurts of liking you
in between.

2278
01:34:02,288 --> 01:34:04,464
Do you know how hard it is
for me to watch you

2279
01:34:04,464 --> 01:34:06,336
be father of the year
all of a sudden?

2280
01:34:06,336 --> 01:34:09,644
Do you know how painful
it is for me?

2281
01:34:10,166 --> 01:34:12,385
They get a version of you
that I never had.

2282
01:34:12,385 --> 01:34:16,215
I-I never even got to live
with you past the age of 11.

2283
01:34:16,215 --> 01:34:20,350
I don't even remember
what you look like in pajamas.

2284
01:34:21,351 --> 01:34:23,440
We're just friends, you and I,

2285
01:34:23,440 --> 01:34:26,486
but-but they have you,
all of you.

2286
01:34:26,486 --> 01:34:28,445
Th-They get you,
and I never did.

2287
01:34:28,445 --> 01:34:30,795
But do you know
who shows up for you?

2288
01:34:30,795 --> 01:34:33,668
Do you know who's
always there for you? Me.

2289
01:34:33,668 --> 01:34:36,583
- I know.
- For better or for worse, man.

2290
01:34:36,583 --> 01:34:38,585
Because I'm the only person
that loves you

2291
01:34:38,585 --> 01:34:40,500
as much as you love yourself.

2292
01:34:40,500 --> 01:34:42,459
And another thing.

2293
01:34:42,459 --> 01:34:44,156
D-Do you know why
I married Pete?

2294
01:34:44,156 --> 01:34:46,637
Because he's nothing like you.

2295
01:34:46,637 --> 01:34:49,684
And maybe that, maybe that's
why you don't like him.

2296
01:34:49,684 --> 01:34:50,946
Okay, honey, please.

2297
01:34:50,946 --> 01:34:52,861
Do you know that every time
I-I see you,

2298
01:34:52,861 --> 01:34:56,081
I want to run into your arms
and slap you?

2299
01:34:56,081 --> 01:34:59,694
I mean, it's the single most
confusing thing in my life.

2300
01:34:59,694 --> 01:35:04,786
Because nobody, nobody can
break my heart like--

2301
01:35:05,917 --> 01:35:06,962
Oh, my God.

2302
01:35:06,962 --> 01:35:08,528
What? What's going on?

2303
01:35:09,268 --> 01:35:11,227
Oh, my God, it's happening
and I'm with you!

2304
01:35:11,227 --> 01:35:12,315
What? What's happening?

2305
01:35:12,315 --> 01:35:14,621
- I'm sorr-- What?
- It, Dad! It!

2306
01:35:14,621 --> 01:35:16,580
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

2307
01:35:16,580 --> 01:35:18,060
- Okay. This is okay.
- The doctor last week told me

2308
01:35:18,060 --> 01:35:19,714
that I was on track
for full term,

2309
01:35:19,714 --> 01:35:21,367
but I'm not due
for three and a half more weeks.

2310
01:35:21,367 --> 01:35:22,760
- Okay. Okay.
- And-and I'm not dilated.

2311
01:35:22,760 --> 01:35:24,588
And this isn't supposed
to happen

2312
01:35:24,588 --> 01:35:26,024
- with your first baby.
- Right.

2313
01:35:26,024 --> 01:35:27,417
Oh, my God, Mom is
in New York and Pete--

2314
01:35:27,417 --> 01:35:28,766
- No, we're good.
- Pete. Okay.

2315
01:35:28,766 --> 01:35:30,246
- What do we do?
- Y-You got to call Pete.

2316
01:35:30,246 --> 01:35:31,508
You got to call Pete
and you got to tell him

2317
01:35:31,508 --> 01:35:32,683
he's got to grab the bag.

2318
01:35:32,683 --> 01:35:34,119
Got it, got it.
Should we go upstairs?

2319
01:35:34,119 --> 01:35:36,469
No, Dad, we have to go
to the hospital!

2320
01:35:36,469 --> 01:35:37,732
Got it. Let's go. Okay.

2321
01:35:37,732 --> 01:35:39,037
W-Will you call Pete?
Where's your car?

2322
01:35:39,037 --> 01:35:40,256
Come on. Come on. Here. Hey.

2323
01:35:40,256 --> 01:35:41,823
Pete. Pete, Grace is in labor.

2324
01:35:41,823 --> 01:35:42,911
We're on our way
to the hospital.

2325
01:35:42,911 --> 01:35:44,086
Let's go. Come on.
It's go time.

2326
01:35:44,086 --> 01:35:44,869
Tell him to grab the bag.

2327
01:35:44,869 --> 01:35:45,914
Hey, grab the bag, dude.

2328
01:35:45,914 --> 01:35:47,306
And the slippers by my bedside.

2329
01:35:47,306 --> 01:35:48,655
Okay, and grab the slippers,
her slippers,

2330
01:35:48,655 --> 01:35:49,569
on her side of the bed.

2331
01:35:49,569 --> 01:35:51,223
Yeah, and, uh, and my cozy robe,

2332
01:35:51,223 --> 01:35:53,269
not the one that I blow-dry
my hair in, the other one.

2333
01:35:53,269 --> 01:35:54,966
Grab the cozy robe,
not the other one,

2334
01:35:54,966 --> 01:35:56,098
not the hair-drying one.
What else?

2335
01:35:56,098 --> 01:35:57,752
- Aromatherapy spray.
- Aromatherapy.

2336
01:35:57,752 --> 01:35:59,231
Don't forget
the aromatherapy spray.

2337
01:35:59,231 --> 01:36:01,059
Oh, oh, oh, oh!
And the cord blood kit.

2338
01:36:01,059 --> 01:36:02,626
- It's over by the front door.
- Do you want to talk to him?

2339
01:36:03,845 --> 01:36:05,194
Okay.

2340
01:36:05,194 --> 01:36:06,630
Okay, sweetie.

2341
01:36:06,630 --> 01:36:07,936
- You're having a contraction.
- Squeeze my hand.

2342
01:36:07,936 --> 01:36:09,328
Just, there you go.
Squeeze that.

2343
01:36:09,328 --> 01:36:10,765
There you go.

2344
01:36:10,765 --> 01:36:11,940
You're doing great.
It's almost over.

2345
01:36:11,940 --> 01:36:13,332
- Worst is over.
- Dad?

2346
01:36:13,332 --> 01:36:15,378
- Yeah?
- I'm really glad you're here.

2347
01:36:15,378 --> 01:36:17,946
Me, too, babe.
Me, too. I'm so glad.

2348
01:36:17,946 --> 01:36:20,122
I'm really sorr--

2349
01:36:20,122 --> 01:36:22,951
- Squeeze this one for a while.
- I'm okay now, Dad.

2350
01:36:22,951 --> 01:36:24,604
I'm okay, I'm okay.
I'm okay right now.

2351
01:36:24,604 --> 01:36:26,563
- Okay. Come on.
- Yeah, I'm okay.

2352
01:36:26,563 --> 01:36:28,130
Oh, and I'm sorry about
all the horrible things

2353
01:36:28,130 --> 01:36:29,522
that I said to you.

2354
01:36:29,522 --> 01:36:31,394
Please, don't even
think about that.

2355
01:36:31,394 --> 01:36:33,048
Don't worry about that.
You're hormonal.

2356
01:36:33,048 --> 01:36:35,311
No, no, I meant them.
I just shouldn't have said them.

2357
01:36:35,311 --> 01:36:36,834
It was really mean of me,

2358
01:36:36,834 --> 01:36:39,968
and I hate when I get like that,
and I'm really sorry.

2359
01:36:39,968 --> 01:36:41,447
Don't worry about it.
It's okay.

2360
01:36:41,447 --> 01:36:43,145
-  Okay.
- Yeah.

2361
01:36:43,145 --> 01:36:44,363
Yeah.

2362
01:36:44,363 --> 01:36:45,800
- Hey.
- Yeah?

2363
01:36:45,800 --> 01:36:47,192
You're having a baby tonight.

2364
01:36:47,192 --> 01:36:48,541
- Yeah.
- In fact,

2365
01:36:48,541 --> 01:36:50,282
this baby might be born
on Christmas.

2366
01:36:50,282 --> 01:36:52,937
It's the most
religious thing I've ever done.

2367
01:36:52,937 --> 01:36:54,983
Well, Grace,
you're progressing really fast.

2368
01:36:54,983 --> 01:36:56,593
So, if you're comfortable
with the epidural,

2369
01:36:56,593 --> 01:36:58,073
I think we should
move ahead with it.

2370
01:36:58,073 --> 01:36:59,944
Okay, I-I actually
was kind of hoping

2371
01:36:59,944 --> 01:37:02,120
to go without that,
if that's okay.

2372
01:37:02,120 --> 01:37:03,295
It could slow things down

2373
01:37:03,295 --> 01:37:04,514
but will definitely help
with the pain.

2374
01:37:05,820 --> 01:37:07,952
Yeah. Okay. She wants that.

2375
01:37:07,952 --> 01:37:10,128
Okay, looks like I'm gonna
be here for a little while,

2376
01:37:10,128 --> 01:37:13,828
but I'll call you as soon as
the baby's born, okay?

2377
01:37:14,219 --> 01:37:16,047
Yes, I promise.

2378
01:37:16,047 --> 01:37:17,832
I promise.

2379
01:37:17,832 --> 01:37:20,399
I know.
I'm glad she's home, too.

2380
01:37:20,399 --> 01:37:23,054
Okay. Okay, love you.

2381
01:37:23,054 --> 01:37:24,447
Okay, love you. Hey, Pete.

2382
01:37:24,447 --> 01:37:25,274
Oh, God.

2383
01:37:25,274 --> 01:37:26,666
- Come on, Pete.
- Hey.

2384
01:37:26,666 --> 01:37:27,842
- Whoa. You all right?
- How is she?

2385
01:37:27,842 --> 01:37:29,234
- She's good.
- Oh, good.

2386
01:37:29,234 --> 01:37:30,757
Come on. Come here.

2387
01:37:30,757 --> 01:37:31,933
- Hey.
- Hey.

2388
01:37:31,933 --> 01:37:33,456
- Hey.
- You okay?

2389
01:37:33,456 --> 01:37:35,197
- How is she doing?
- Oh, she's doing great.

2390
01:37:35,197 --> 01:37:37,547
I think the feeling's starting
to come back in my hand.

2391
01:37:37,547 --> 01:37:39,070
- I'm gonna be a dad.
- You're gonna be a dad.

2392
01:37:40,158 --> 01:37:41,464
Good luck with that, Pete.

2393
01:37:43,858 --> 01:37:45,424
Uh-oh.

2394
01:37:45,860 --> 01:37:47,557
Hey, Grace?
We are gonna go ahead

2395
01:37:47,557 --> 01:37:49,080
and turn you on your side, okay?

2396
01:37:49,080 --> 01:37:50,908
-Wait, what? Pete!
- Wh-What-What's happening?

2397
01:37:50,908 --> 01:37:52,170
- I don't know what's happening.
-Hello, everybody.

2398
01:37:52,170 --> 01:37:53,128
Okay, let's see what's going on.

2399
01:37:53,128 --> 01:37:54,520
Oh, okay, so your contractions

2400
01:37:54,520 --> 01:37:56,218
are just one on top of the other

2401
01:37:56,218 --> 01:37:57,697
and the baby's having
a hard time

2402
01:37:57,697 --> 01:37:59,134
normalizing its heart rate.

2403
01:37:59,134 --> 01:38:02,050
So, let's put her on
her other side. Here we go.

2404
01:38:02,050 --> 01:38:03,442
- So, Mom and Dad.
- GRACE and PETE: Yeah.

2405
01:38:03,442 --> 01:38:04,748
This is the plan.

2406
01:38:04,748 --> 01:38:06,097
I'm gonna just wait
for a couple of minutes,

2407
01:38:06,097 --> 01:38:07,620
see if the heart rate
normalizes by itself.

2408
01:38:07,620 --> 01:38:09,579
We want to see
the heart rate go up.

2409
01:38:09,579 --> 01:38:12,843
And if not, I'm gonna go in and
perform an emergency C-section.

2410
01:38:12,843 --> 01:38:14,105
Wait, what?

2411
01:38:14,105 --> 01:38:15,585
Oh, my God.

2412
01:38:15,585 --> 01:38:18,893
Hey, let's just
talk through this, okay?

2413
01:38:18,893 --> 01:38:20,329
- Hey.
- Yeah.

2414
01:38:20,329 --> 01:38:21,983
- Let's just talk through this.
- Okay.

2415
01:38:21,983 --> 01:38:24,811
Okay? The baby's gonna be
just fine, I promise.

2416
01:38:24,811 --> 01:38:26,639
Hold my hand. Hey.

2417
01:38:26,639 --> 01:38:28,380
We're gonna bring the baby home
to that beautiful

2418
01:38:28,380 --> 01:38:30,905
gender-neutral nursery
you set up.

2419
01:38:30,905 --> 01:38:33,168
And we're not gonna sleep
for like six months,

2420
01:38:33,168 --> 01:38:34,691
but it won't matter.

2421
01:38:34,691 --> 01:38:36,823
And then, before you know it,
it's gonna be

2422
01:38:36,823 --> 01:38:38,738
the first day of school.
Can you believe that?

2423
01:38:38,738 --> 01:38:41,524
But I'm gonna be a basket case.

2424
01:38:41,524 --> 01:38:44,701
But you, you're gonna be solid
and put together.

2425
01:38:44,701 --> 01:38:46,746
A total ace.

2426
01:38:46,746 --> 01:38:48,574
And then you're gonna
break down in the car.

2427
01:38:48,574 --> 01:38:51,186
-And we're gonna
have great family vacations.

2428
01:38:51,186 --> 01:38:53,231
Because you make
the best itineraries.

2429
01:38:53,231 --> 01:38:55,277
Yeah. And we're gonna
take a picture of us

2430
01:38:55,277 --> 01:38:57,714
holding the Leaning Tower
of Pisa like that.

2431
01:38:57,714 --> 01:39:00,108
And we're also gonna make
a ton of mistakes.

2432
01:39:00,108 --> 01:39:01,718
But then we're gonna
have a second kid...

2433
01:39:01,718 --> 01:39:02,980
Oh.

2434
01:39:02,980 --> 01:39:04,677
And we're gonna make less.

2435
01:39:06,157 --> 01:39:08,159
I think our baby's gonna be
really embarrassed by us

2436
01:39:08,159 --> 01:39:09,726
for a while in high school.

2437
01:39:09,726 --> 01:39:11,858
Especially me. I know it.

2438
01:39:12,337 --> 01:39:14,470
But we'll get through it.
And we're gonna have each other.

2439
01:39:14,470 --> 01:39:16,863
- Right?
- Yeah.

2440
01:39:16,863 --> 01:39:18,126
And then college.

2441
01:39:18,126 --> 01:39:20,258
We're buying sheets
for an extra-long twin?

2442
01:39:20,258 --> 01:39:22,434
How did that happen?

2443
01:39:25,263 --> 01:39:26,873
I think our baby's
really gonna miss us

2444
01:39:26,873 --> 01:39:28,658
when they go to college.

2445
01:39:28,963 --> 01:39:31,008
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

2446
01:39:32,183 --> 01:39:33,793
And I think
we're gonna get ourselves

2447
01:39:33,793 --> 01:39:35,882
a little apartment
on the East Coast.

2448
01:39:35,882 --> 01:39:38,973
Have ourselves
a little renaissance.

2449
01:39:39,408 --> 01:39:41,801
It's gonna be so great, Grace.

2450
01:39:44,456 --> 01:39:46,154
And it's just starting.

2451
01:39:46,154 --> 01:39:48,983
Right here, right now.

2452
01:39:48,983 --> 01:39:50,027
Yeah.

2453
01:39:50,027 --> 01:39:52,943
- I love you so much.
- I love you.

2454
01:39:57,252 --> 01:39:59,950
Dad, are you crying?

2455
01:40:00,298 --> 01:40:01,517
No.

2456
01:40:01,517 --> 01:40:02,779
No, not at all.

2457
01:40:02,779 --> 01:40:06,565
Okay, baby's heart rate
is coming back up.

2458
01:40:06,565 --> 01:40:08,045
- Good job, Dad.
- Oh, wow.

2459
01:40:08,045 --> 01:40:09,438
-Take a quick look.
-You sure?

2460
01:40:09,438 --> 01:40:10,700
-  Yeah.
- Okay, great.

2461
01:40:10,700 --> 01:40:13,094
Let me take a look.

2462
01:40:13,572 --> 01:40:16,140
Okay. I think
we're ready to push.

2463
01:40:16,140 --> 01:40:18,012
You ready, Grace?

2464
01:40:18,012 --> 01:40:19,143
- I-I--
-You got this.

2465
01:40:19,143 --> 01:40:20,188
- I'm ready.
- Yes, you are.

2466
01:40:20,188 --> 01:40:21,754
- Okay.
- You got it.

2467
01:40:21,754 --> 01:40:23,234
All right,
she's ten centimeters.

2468
01:40:23,234 --> 01:40:25,062
- Pushing. I'm gonna--
- Everyone, step out

2469
01:40:25,062 --> 01:40:26,368
- who's not essential, please.
- I'm gonna step out of here.

2470
01:40:26,368 --> 01:40:28,326
- Okay.
-Okay. Just relax.

2471
01:40:28,326 --> 01:40:30,589
Hey, sweetie.

2472
01:40:30,589 --> 01:40:32,678
Yeah, Dad?

2473
01:40:33,462 --> 01:40:35,594
One more thing, you know,
before I go.

2474
01:40:40,599 --> 01:40:43,820
You know you're
my soulmate, right?

2475
01:40:45,735 --> 01:40:47,606
Just wanted to tell you.

2476
01:40:47,606 --> 01:40:49,652
That's it.

2477
01:40:55,875 --> 01:40:58,400
Okay, I'll...

2478
01:40:59,009 --> 01:41:00,924
- Okay, let's do it.
-Okay.

2479
01:41:00,924 --> 01:41:02,317

She was amazing,
a superhero, really.

Oh, I'm not surprised.
Of course, she is a superhero.
