# App Icon Placeholder

The app requires an icon.icns file in this directory.

## Creating the Icon

1. **Design**: Create a 1024x1024 PNG with the Subzilla logo (ðŸ¦Ž)
2. **Convert**: Use iconutil or online converter to create .icns
3. **Place**: Save as `icon.icns` in this directory

## Temporary Solution

For testing, you can:
1. Find any .icns file from another Mac app
2. Copy it as `icon.icns` in this directory
3. The app will use it as placeholder until proper icon is created

The icon should represent:
- Subzilla branding (lizard/gecko theme)
- Subtitle/text processing concept  
- Clean, modern macOS design language
